of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of that date, the Company had
outstanding 2,579,759 shares of Common Stock. The holders of a majority of such shares,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is
necessary before business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting except that, even if a quorum is
not present, the shareholders present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Each shareholder entitled to vote shall have

the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the shareholder signing such Proxy Card. The
Proxy Card provides a space for a shareholder to vote for the Board&#146;s nominee, or to withhold
authority to vote for such nominee, for election as the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;I director and to vote for
or against or to abstain from voting with respect to the proposal to approve the adoption of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Class&nbsp;I director is to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote thereon is
required to approve the adoption of the Company&#146;s 2006 Equity Compensation Plan or to take action
on any other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting, unless with respect to
any other matter a greater percentage is required either by law or by the Company&#146;s Restated

will be excluded entirely from the vote and will have no effect. With regard to the approval of
the adoption of the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan or any other matters properly brought before the
Annual Meeting, votes may be cast &#147;for&#148; or &#147;against&#148; or the shareholder may abstain from voting. In
determining the number of votes cast with respect to any voting matter, only those cast &#147;for&#148; or

Meeting but will not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on the
vote. In addition, where brokers submit proxies but are prohibited and thus refrain from exercising
discretionary authority in voting shares on certain matters for beneficial owners who have not
provided voting instructions with respect to such matters (commonly referred to as &#147;broker

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and a Compensation and Human
Resources Committee. The members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee also constitute
the members of the committee that administers the Company&#146;s 1996 Equity Compensation Plan (the
&#147;Stock Option Committee&#148;). During fiscal year 2005, the Board held six meetings, the Audit
Committee held five meetings, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee held two meetings, the
Stock Option Committee did not meet separately from the Compensation and Human Resources Committee
and the Executive Committee did not hold any meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the
aggregate of the fiscal year 2005 meetings of the Board and of the Board committees on which he
served during the year. The Company had a Nominating Committee until the death of one its members
in 2001; since that time, the full Board has assumed responsibility for the duties normally
associated with a nominating committee. After The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) adopted new
rules and regulations in late 2003 relating to corporate governance and listing requirements, the
Board reconsidered its decision not to have a formal Nominating Committee and determined that this
decision was appropriate based on a number of factors, including the size of the current Board, the
number of independent directors and the existing commitments of those independent directors to
other Board committees. In addition, the Board determined that recommendations regarding future
director nominations, including nominations as a result of vacancies, would be made by a majority
of the Company&#146;s independent directors and that the final selection would be made by the entire
Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of the Board, except action on
dividends and certain other matters that cannot by law be delegated by the Board, during the
periods between regular Board meetings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company operates within a comprehensive plan of corporate governance for the purpose of
defining director independence, assigning Board responsibilities, setting high standards of
professional and personal conduct for directors, officers and employees and assuring compliance
with such responsibilities and standards. The Company regularly monitors developments in the area
of corporate governance. In July&nbsp;2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which, among
other things, established or provided the basis for a number of new corporate governance standards
and disclosure requirements. In addition, Nasdaq also adopted changes to its corporate governance

defined in Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4200(a)(15) of the National Association of Securities Dealers (the
&#147;NASD&#148;): Norman Cohen, Robert A. Engel, Edward T. Hurd and Richard J. Pinola. The Board also has
determined that each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee
and the Stock Option Committee meets the independence requirements applicable to those committees
as prescribed by the NASD, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and
applicable committee charters. The Board has further determined that Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola and Engel, who
are two of the three members of the Audit Committee, are each an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148;
as such term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation&nbsp;S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual retainer of $18,000, a $5,000
annual retainer for membership on the Audit Committee, a $2,500 annual retainer for membership on
the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, a $1,000 annual retainer for membership on the
Executive Committee and $1,000 for each Board meeting attended. In addition, the Chairperson of
the Audit Committee is paid an additional $5,000 retainer for his service in such capacity and the
Chairperson of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee is paid an additional $2,500 retainer
for his service in such capacity. All retainers are paid on a prorated bi-monthly basis.
Directors generally do not receive compensation for their participation in telephone meetings or
for attendance at other committee meetings. In addition, on May&nbsp;13, 2005 each non-employee
director was granted an option to purchase 1,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price per
share equal to the closing price on the date of grant.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each non-employee director is expected to own shares of Common Stock with a value, at the
greater of cost or market, equal to $50,000. As for any newly-elected director, this expectation
may be phased in over a period of time to be determined by the Board. All directors are in
compliance with this guideline.

shareholders except where the failure to attend is due to unavoidable circumstances or conflicts
discussed in advance by such director with the Chairman of the Board. All members of the Board
attended the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders, except for Mr.&nbsp;Engel.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board provides a process for shareholders to send communications to the Board.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By resolution, the Board has adopted a policy regarding director nominations. Under this
policy, a majority of the Company&#146;s independent directors shall recommend for the Board&#146;s selection
a candidate or candidates, as appropriate, to be the Board&#146;s nominee or nominees for election as a
director or directors, either at an annual meeting of shareholders or to fill a vacancy. In
considering candidates for nomination, the Board shall seek individuals who evidence strength of
character, mature judgment and the ability to work collegially with others. Furthermore, it is the
policy of the Board that it endeavor to have directors who collectively possess a broad range of
skills, expertise, industry and other knowledge and business and other experience useful to the
effective oversight of the Company&#146;s business; therefore, in considering whether to nominate a
person for election as a director, the independent directors and the Board will consider, among
other factors, the contribution such person can make to the collective competencies of the Board
based on such person&#146;s background. In determining whether to nominate a current director for
reelection, the independent directors and the Board will take into account these same criteria as
well as the director&#146;s past performance, including his or her participation in and contributions to
the activities of the Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will also consider candidates for nomination recommended by a shareholder provided
that the shareholder submits the recommendation, along with the following information, to the
Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company at least 120&nbsp;days before
the date on which the Company first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year&#146;s annual meeting

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>APPROVAL OF ADOPTION OF K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC.<BR>
2006 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;21, 2006, the Board adopted the K-Tron International, Inc. 2006 Equity Compensation
Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;), subject to shareholder approval. The Board has directed that the proposal to
approve its adoption of the Plan be submitted to the Company&#146;s shareholders at the Annual Meeting.
Shareholder approval is being sought (i)&nbsp;in order for the shares covered by the Plan to meet the
listing requirements of the Nasdaq National Market, (ii)&nbsp;so that compensation attributable to
grants under the Plan may qualify for an exemption from the $1&nbsp;million deduction limit under
section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#147;Code&#148;) (see discussion of &#147;Federal Income
Tax Consequences&#148; below), and (iii)&nbsp;in order for any incentive stock options granted thereunder to
meet the requirements of the Code.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board believes that the Plan will further the Company&#146;s compensation strategy. The
Company&#146;s ability to attract, retain and motivate top quality employees and non-employee directors
is material to the Company&#146;s success. The Board believes that the interests of the Company and its
shareholders will be advanced if the Company can offer its employees and non-employee directors the
opportunity to acquire or increase their ownership interests in the Company by receiving grants
under the Plan. The Company&#146;s only existing equity compensation plan will expire on May 9 of this
year, which is three days before the scheduled date of the Annual Meeting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material terms of the Plan are summarized below. A copy of the full text of the Plan is
attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix&nbsp;A. This summary of the Plan is not intended to be a
complete description of the Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the actual text of the Plan to
which reference is made.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>General</I>. The Plan provides that grants may be made in any of the following forms: (i)
incentive stock options, (ii)&nbsp;nonqualified stock options (incentive stock options and nonqualified
stock options are collectively referred to as &#147;options&#148;), (iii)&nbsp;stock awards, (iv)&nbsp;stock units, (v)
stock appreciation rights (&#147;SARs&#148;), (vi)&nbsp;dividend equivalents and (vii)&nbsp;other stock-based awards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan authorizes up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance, subject to adjustment
in certain circumstances as described below. If and to the extent options and SARs granted under
the Plan terminate, expire or are cancelled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered without being
exercised or if any stock awards, stock units or

become available again for purposes of the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan provides that the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock with respect to
which grants may be made to any individual during any calendar year is 50,000 shares, subject to
adjustment as described below. All grants under the Plan will be expressed in shares of Common
Stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If approved by the shareholders, the Plan will become effective on May&nbsp;12, 2006 or, if later,
the date of such approval.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Administration</I>. The Plan will be administered and interpreted by the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee of the Board, any successor Board committee performing substantially the same
functions or such other committee of non-employee directors as the Board may determine (the
&#147;Committee&#148;). However, the Board will approve and administer all grants made to non-employee
directors. The Committee has the authority to (i)&nbsp;determine the individuals to whom grants will be
made under the Plan, (ii)&nbsp;determine the type, size, terms and conditions of the grants, (iii)
determine when grants will be made and the duration of any applicable exercise or restriction
period, including the criteria for exercisability and the acceleration of exercisability, (iv)
amend the terms and conditions of any previously issued grant, subject to the limitations described
below, and (v)&nbsp;deal with any other matters arising under the Plan. The Committee presently
consists of Messrs.&nbsp;Cohen (Chairman) and Pinola, each of whom is a non-employee director of the
Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Eligibility for Participation</I>. All employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and all
non-employee directors of the Company are eligible to receive grants under the Plan. As of March
17, 2006, approximately 530 employees and four non-employee directors are eligible to receive
grants under the Plan. The Committee is authorized to select the persons to receive grants from
among those eligible and to determine the number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to each
grant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may grant options intended to qualify as &#147;incentive stock options&#148; within the
meaning of section 422 of the Code (&#147;ISOs&#148;) or &#147;nonqualified stock options&#148; that are not intended
to so qualify (&#147;NQSOs&#148;) or any combination of ISOs and NQSOs. Anyone eligible to participate in
the Plan may receive a grant of NQSOs. Only employees of the Company and its subsidiaries may
receive a grant of ISOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will fix the exercise price per share of options on the date of grant. The
exercise price of options granted under the Plan may be equal to or greater than the fair market
value of the underlying shares of Common Stock on the date of grant. However, if the grantee of an
ISO is a person who holds more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
outstanding stock of the Company, the exercise price per share of an ISO granted to such person
must be at least 110% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. If
the aggregate fair market value of shares of Common Stock, determined on the date of grant, with
respect to which ISOs become exercisable for the first time by a grantee during any calendar year
exceeds $100,000, such ISOs, to the extent of such excess over $100,000, will be treated as NQSOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will determine the term of each option, but such term may not exceed ten years
from the date of grant; however, if the grantee of an ISO is a person who holds more than 10% of
the combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock of the Company, the term of the ISO
may not exceed five years from the date of grant. The Committee will determine the terms and
conditions of options, including when they become exercisable. The Committee may accelerate the
exercisability of any options.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grantee may exercise an option by delivering notice of exercise to the Company. The grantee
will pay the exercise price and any withholding taxes for the option: (i)&nbsp;in cash, (ii)&nbsp;unless the
Committee determines otherwise, by delivering shares of Common Stock already owned by the grantee
and having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price or to that
portion thereof not paid in cash, (iii)&nbsp;by payment through a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will determine under what circumstances a grantee may exercise an option after
termination of employment or service, but in no event may this be later than the expiration of the
option term. Generally, if a grantee ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Company
or any subsidiary for any reason other than disability, death or termination for cause, the
grantee&#146;s options will terminate 90&nbsp;days following the date on which the grantee ceases to be
employed by, or provide service to, the Company or any subsidiary. If a grantee&#146;s employment or
service ceases due to a disability or death, the grantee&#146;s options will terminate one year
following the date on which the grantee ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the
Company or any subsidiary. In each case described above, the Committee may specify a different
option termination date, but in any event no later than the expiration of the option term. If a
grantee ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Company or any subsidiary on account
of termination for cause, the grantee&#146;s options will terminate immediately.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may grant stock awards to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan. The
Committee may require that grantees pay consideration for the stock awards and may impose
restrictions on the stock awards. If restrictions are imposed on stock awards, the Committee will
determine whether they will lapse over a period of time or according to such other criteria as the
Committee determines. The Committee will determine the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
the grant of stock awards and the other terms and conditions of the grant. The Committee will
determine to what extent and under what conditions grantees will have the right to vote shares of
Common Stock and to receive dividends paid on such shares during the restriction period. The
Committee may determine that a grantee&#146;s entitlement to dividends with respect to stock awards will
be subject to the achievement of performance goals or other conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Stock Units</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may grant stock units to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan. Each stock
unit provides the grantee with the right to receive an amount based on the value of a share of
Common Stock at a future date. The Committee will determine the number of stock units to be
granted, whether stock units will become payable based on achievement of performance goals or other
conditions, and the other terms and conditions applicable to stock units. Stock units may be paid
at the end of a specified period or deferred to a date authorized by the Committee. If a stock
unit becomes distributable, it will be paid to the grantee in cash, in shares of Common Stock or in
a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Committee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>SARs</U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may grant SARs to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan. SARs may be
granted in connection with, or independently of, any option granted under the Plan. Upon exercise
of an SAR, the grantee will receive an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of exercise over the base amount of the SAR. Payment will be made in
shares of Common Stock, in cash or in a combination of shares and cash, as determined by the
Committee. The base amount of each SAR will be determined by the Committee and will be equal to
the per share exercise price of the related option or, if there is no related option, an amount
that is at least equal to the value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the SAR.
The Committee will determine the terms and conditions of SARs, including when they become
exercisable. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any SARs. SARs may be exercised
while the grantee is employed by or providing service to the Company and its subsidiaries or within
a specified period of time after termination of such employment or service, as determined by the
Committee.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may grant other stock-based awards, which are grants other than options, stock
awards, stock units or SARs. The Committee may grant other stock-based awards to anyone eligible
to participate in the Plan. These grants will be based on or measured by shares of Common Stock,
and will be payable in cash, in shares

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">of Common Stock or in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the
Committee. The terms and conditions for other stock-based awards will be determined by the
Committee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dividend Equivalents. </I>The Committee may grant dividend equivalents in connection with stock
units or other stock-based awards. Dividend equivalents are payable in cash or shares of Common
Stock and may be paid currently or accrued as contingent obligations. The terms and conditions of
dividend equivalents will be determined by the Committee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Qualified Performance-Based Compensation</I>. The Plan permits the Committee to impose objective
performance goals that must be met with respect to grants of stock awards, stock units, other
stock-based awards or dividend equivalents granted to employees under the Plan, in order for the
grants to be considered qualified performance-based compensation for purposes of section 162(m) of
the Code (see &#147;Federal Income Tax Consequences&#148; below). Prior to, or soon after the beginning of,
the performance period, the Committee will establish in writing the performance goals that must be
met, the applicable performance period, the amounts to be paid if the performance goals are met and
any other conditions. The Committee may provide in the grant agreement that qualified
performance-based grants will be payable or restrictions on such grants will lapse, in whole or
part, in the event of the grantee&#146;s death or disability during the performance period or under
other circumstances consistent with Treasury regulations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance goals, to the extent designed to meet the requirements of section 162(m) of
the Code, will be based on one or more of the following measures: stock price, earnings per share,
net earnings, operating earnings, earnings before income taxes, EBITDA (earnings before income tax
expense, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization expense), return on assets,
shareholder return, return on equity, growth in assets, unit volume, sales, market share or
strategic business criteria consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified revenue
goals, market penetration goals, geographic business expansion goals, cost targets or goals
relating to acquisitions or divestitures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If dividend equivalents are granted as qualified performance-based compensation under section
162(m) of the Code, the grantee may not accrue more than $50,000 of such dividend equivalents
during any calendar year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Deferrals</I>. The Committee may permit or require grantees to defer receipt of the payment of
cash or the delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due to the grantee in
connection with any stock units or other stock-based awards under the Plan. The Committee will
establish the rules and procedures applicable to any such deferrals and may provide for interest or
other earnings to be paid on such deferrals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Adjustment Provisions</I>. If there is any change in the number or kind of shares of Common Stock
by reason of a stock dividend, spinoff, recapitalization, stock split or combination or exchange of
shares, by reason of a merger, reorganization or consolidation, by reason of a reclassification or
change in par value or by reason of any other extraordinary or unusual event affecting the
outstanding shares of Common Stock as a class without the Company&#146;s receipt of consideration, or if
the value of outstanding shares of Common Stock is substantially reduced as a result of a spinoff
or the Company&#146;s payment of an extraordinary dividend or distribution, the number of shares of
Common Stock available for grants, the limit on the number of shares of Common Stock any individual
may receive pursuant to grants in any year, the number of shares covered by outstanding grants, the
kind of shares to be issued under the Plan, and the price per share or the applicable market value
of such grants will be appropriately adjusted by the Committee to reflect any increase or decrease
in the number or kind of issued shares of Common Stock in order to preclude, to the extent
practicable, the enlargement or dilution of the rights and benefits under such grants. Any
fractional shares resulting from such adjustment will be eliminated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Change of Control. </I>If the Company becomes aware that a change of control, as defined in the
Plan, has occurred or will occur, the Company shall provide written notice of such change of
control to each grantee who holds outstanding grants under the Plan. Effective upon the date of
the change of control, (i)&nbsp;all outstanding options and SARs will automatically accelerate and
become fully exercisable, (ii)&nbsp;the restrictions and conditions on all outstanding stock awards will
immediately lapse and (iii)&nbsp;all stock units, dividend equivalents and other stock-based awards will
become fully vested and will be paid at their target value or in such greater amounts as the
Committee may determine.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a change of control, the Committee may take any of the following actions with
respect to any or all outstanding grants under the Plan: (i)&nbsp;require that grantees surrender their
options and SARs in exchange for payment by the Company, in cash or shares of Common Stock as
determined by the Committee, in an amount equal to the amount by which the then fair market value
of the shares subject to the grantee&#146;s unexercised options and SARs exceeds the exercise price of
the options or the base amount of the SARs, as applicable; (ii)&nbsp;after giving grantees the
opportunity to exercise their options and SARs, terminate any or all unexercised options and SARs
at such time as the Committee determines appropriate; or (iii)&nbsp;determine that outstanding options
and SARS that are not exercised will be assumed by, or replaced with comparable options or rights
by, the surviving corporation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transferability of Grants. </I>Only the grantee may exercise rights under a grant during the
grantee&#146;s lifetime. A grantee may not transfer those rights except by will or the laws of descent
and distribution; provided, however, that a grantee may transfer a grant other than an ISO pursuant
to a domestic relations order. The Committee may also provide, in a grant agreement, that a
grantee may transfer NQSOs to his or her family members, or one or more trusts or other entities
for the benefit of or owned by such family members, consistent with applicable securities laws,
according to such terms as the Committee may determine.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Grantees Outside the United States</I>. If any individual who receives a grant under the Plan is
subject to taxation in a country other than the United States, the Committee may make the grant on
such terms and conditions as the Committee determines appropriate to comply with the laws of the
applicable country.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>No Repricing of Options</I>. Neither the Board nor the Committee can amend the Plan or options
previously granted under the Plan to permit a repricing of options, without prior shareholder
approval. Adjustments to the exercise price or number of shares of Common Stock subject to an
option to reflect the effects of a stock split or other corporate transaction will not constitute a
repricing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Amendment and Termination of the Plan</I>. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time,
subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required under any applicable laws or stock
exchange requirements. The Plan will terminate on May&nbsp;11, 2016, unless the Plan is terminated
earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with shareholder consent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Grants Under the Plan</I>. No grants have been made under the Plan. Grants under the Plan are
discretionary, so it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares of Common Stock that
will be granted or who will receive grants under the Plan after the Annual Meeting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closing price of the Company&#146;s Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market on
March&nbsp;17, 2006, was $43.60 per share.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Federal Income Tax Consequences</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal income tax consequences of grants under the Plan will depend on the type of grant.
The following description provides only a general description of the application of federal income
tax laws to grants under the Plan. This discussion is intended for the information of shareholders
considering how to vote at the Annual Meeting and not as tax guidance to grantees, as the
consequences may vary with the types of grants made, the identity of the grantees and the method of
payment or settlement. The summary does not address the effects of other federal taxes (including
possible &#147;golden parachute&#148; excise taxes) or taxes imposed under state, local or foreign tax laws.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the grantees&#146; standpoint, as a general rule, ordinary income will be recognized at the
time of delivery of shares of Common Stock or payment of cash under the Plan. Future appreciation
on shares of Common Stock held beyond the ordinary income recognition event will be taxable as
capital gain when the shares of Common Stock are sold. The tax rate applicable to the capital gain
will depend upon how long the grantee holds the shares. The Company, as a general rule, will be
entitled to a tax deduction that corresponds in time and amount to the ordinary income recognized
by the grantee, and the Company will not be entitled to any tax deduction with respect to capital
gain income recognized by the grantee.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions to these general rules arise under the following circumstances:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;If shares of Common Stock, when delivered, are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture
by reason of any employment or performance-related condition, ordinary income taxation and the
Company&#146;s tax deduction will be delayed until the risk of forfeiture lapses, unless the grantee
makes a special election to accelerate taxation under section 83(b) of the Code.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;If an employee exercises a stock option that qualifies as an ISO, no ordinary income will
be recognized, and the Company will not be entitled to any tax deduction, if shares of Common Stock
acquired upon exercise of the stock option are held until the later of (A)&nbsp;one year from the date
of exercise and (B)&nbsp;two years from the date of grant. However, if the employee disposes of the
shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO before satisfying both holding period requirements, the
employee will recognize ordinary income to the extent of the difference between the fair market
value of the shares on the date of exercise (or the amount realized on the disposition, if less)
and the exercise price, and the Company will be entitled to a tax deduction in that amount. The
gain, if any, in excess of the amount recognized as ordinary income will be long-term or short-term
capital gain, depending upon the length of time the employee held the shares before the
disposition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;A grant may be subject to a 20% tax, in addition to ordinary income tax, at the time the
grant becomes vested, plus interest, if the grant constitutes deferred compensation under section
409A of the Code and the requirements of section 409A of the Code are not satisfied.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code generally disallows a publicly-held corporation&#146;s tax deduction for
compensation paid to its chief executive officer or any of its four other most highly compensated
officers in excess of $1&nbsp;million in any year. Qualified performance-based compensation is excluded
from the $1&nbsp;million deductibility limit, and therefore remains fully deductible by the corporation
that pays it. Options and SARs will generally meet the requirements for qualified
performance-based compensation. Stock awards, stock units, dividend equivalents, and other
stock-based awards granted under the Plan will be designated as qualified performance-based
compensation if the Committee conditions such grants on the achievement of specific performance
goals in accordance with the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has the right to require that grantees pay to the Company an amount necessary for
the Company to satisfy its federal, state or local tax withholding obligations with respect to
grants. The Company may withhold from other amounts payable to a grantee an amount necessary to
satisfy these obligations. The Committee may permit a grantee to satisfy the Company&#146;s withholding
obligation with respect to a grant paid in Common Stock by having shares withheld, at the time the
grant becomes taxable, provided that the number of shares withheld does not exceed the individual&#146;s
minimum applicable withholding tax rate for federal, state and local tax liabilities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to approve the adoption of the Plan requires for its approval the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting
and entitled to vote on this proposal. Abstentions will have no effect on the vote.

Committee of the Board (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) approved 2.0%, 7.2% and 2.1% increases in the
annual base salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt to $233,000, $222,700 and $206,000,
effective April&nbsp;4, 2005, and on March&nbsp;6, 2006, the Compensation Committee approved 2.25% increases
in these annual base salaries to $238,250, $227,750 and $210,650, effective April&nbsp;3, 2006. The
Company&#146;s obligation to pay such base salaries is subject to its right to reduce them in the event
reductions are generally being made for other officers of the Company or its subsidiaries holding
comparable positions.

employment term is also subject to termination by reason of his death or disability or by the Board
at any time for &#147;cause&#148; as specified in his employment agreement. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146;
employment agreement includes provisions relating to a termination of employment upon a &#147;change of
control&#148; (as specified in his employment agreement). These provisions apply to a termination of
employment upon or within one year after a &#147;change of control&#148; which, if such termination was
initiated by the Company or any successor thereto, was for any reason other than death, disability
or &#147;cause&#148; or which, if such termination was initiated by Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, was at his sole discretion
without regard to reason. In the event of the termination of employment of Mr.&nbsp;Cloues upon a

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) operates
pursuant to a formal written charter that was approved and adopted by the Board on March&nbsp;12, 2004
and complies with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of
Securities Dealers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the Compensation Committee, it is our responsibility to carry out the purposes
of the Committee as more fully described on page 6 of this Proxy Statement under the caption
&#147;Matters Concerning Directors &#150; Committees and Meetings&#148; and in the charter referred to above that
is included on the Company&#146;s Internet web site at http://www.ktron.com. In particular, it is our
duty to establish annual base salaries and annual and long-term incentive awards for the executive
officers of the Company and, in this regard, we also constitute the committee (the &#147;Stock Option
Committee&#148;) that administers the Company&#146;s 1996 Equity Compensation Plan, including the granting of
stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to officers and other employees of
the Company. In fulfilling these responsibilities and duties, it is the Compensation Committee&#146;s
goal to have a policy that will enable the Company to attract, retain and reward senior officers
who contribute to both its short-term and long-term success. The two members of the Compensation
Committee meet the independence requirements applicable to compensation committees generally as
prescribed by the National Association of Securities Dealers, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Internal Revenue Service and also as set forth in the Committee&#146;s charter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s compensation policy for executive officers is to pay competitively and to be
fair and equitable in the administration of pay. This is the same policy that is applicable to all
employees of the Company. The Company seeks to balance the compensation paid to a particular
individual with the compensation paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside
the Company and at other similar companies.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisions of the Compensation Committee regarding salaries of the executive officers are
subjective and not based on any list of specific criteria. On March&nbsp;4, 2005, as reported by the
Compensation Committee in last year&#146;s Proxy Statement, the Committee accepted the Chief Executive
Officer&#146;s recommendation that the annual base salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick, Melchiorre and
Guenthardt be increased by approximately 2.0%, 7.2%, 7.3% and 2.1%, effective April&nbsp;4, 2005. At
the same time, the Compensation Committee approved a salary increase of approximately 2.0% for Mr.
Cloues, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, also to take effect on April&nbsp;4, 2005. The decision
of the Compensation Committee to increase the annual base salary of Mr.&nbsp;Cloues was based on a
variety of factors, including the Company&#146;s improved consolidated financial performance in fiscal
year 2004 and the above average increase in its share price for that year. Following these April
4, 2005 increases, Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; annual base salary was $484,500, and the annual base salaries of
Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick, Melchiorre and Guenthardt were $233,000, $222,700, $220,000 and $206,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;6, 2006, the Compensation Committee accepted the Chief Executive Officer&#146;s
recommendation and approved increases in the annual base salaries of each of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick,
Melchiorre and Guenthardt of approximately 2.25%, to $238,250, $227,750, $225,000 and $210,650,
effective April&nbsp;3, 2006. At the same time, the Compensation Committee also approved a 2.25%
increase in Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; annual base salary to $495,400, also effective April&nbsp;3, 2006. The factors
that the Compensation Committee took into account in approving the Chief Executive Officer&#146;s salary
increase as of April&nbsp;3, 2006 were the same as those described below that were the basis for Mr.
Cloues&#146; bonus for fiscal year 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to granting salary increases in 2006, on March&nbsp;6, 2006 the Compensation Committee
also approved the payment of annual cash incentive awards for 2005 to the executive officers,
including the Chief Executive Officer. These awards were made pursuant to bonus guidelines used in
the preparation of the Company&#146;s budget for 2005. Although the budget was approved by the Board,
including both members of the Committee, the Committee retained full discretion to make such
specific incentive bonus awards, if any, as it deemed appropriate, after the end of the year. The
awards made were based on the Company&#146;s achievement of its earnings per share target for 2005, the
amount of pre-tax income generated by the Company in excess of what was necessary to achieve that
earnings per share target and the assessed contribution of each executive to the Company&#146;s success.
As a starting point, the Committee considered the target bonus for each executive used in the 2005
budget, which was the same target bonus (as a percent of base salary) used for the past several
years. This target was 50% of base salary for Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer,
and 30% of base salary for the other executive officers, but the annual cash incentive award for
any executive may be more or less than the applicable target, depending on the Company&#146;s financial
performance, the Committee&#146;s assessment of the executive&#146;s contribution and such other factors as
the Committee may choose to consider.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, was awarded a $380,000 bonus for fiscal
year 2005, which was equal to 78% of his annual base salary at the end of the year. In determining
Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; bonus, the Compensation Committee noted in particular his leadership of the Company in
2005, the achievement of record revenues, operating income, income before taxes, net income,
earnings per share and EBITDA, the substantial increase in cash and reduction in debt during the
year and several other accomplishments. The bonus awards made to the four other executive officers
were recommended by Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, based on his assessment of their contributions to the Company in
fiscal year 2005. For Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick, Melchiorre and Guenthardt, their bonuses for fiscal
year 2005 equaled approximately 45%, 52%, 65% and 45% of their annual base salaries at the end of
fiscal year 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the members of the Compensation Committee also serve as the members of the
Stock Option Committee that administers the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan under which grants of
stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock may be made. The purpose of such
grants is to provide an additional incentive to key employees to work to maximize shareholder
value, and vesting periods may be utilized to encourage such employees to remain with the Company.
Such grants are entirely at the discretion of the Stock Option Committee, including their timing,
the recipients thereof and the number of shares underlying any particular grant. On May&nbsp;13, 2005,
the Compensation Committee granted Messrs.&nbsp;Cloues, Bowen, Remick, Melchiorre and Guenthardt 3,000,
1,500, 1,500, 1,500 and 1,500 shares of restricted Common Stock. Each of these grants of
restricted Common Stock will vest on May&nbsp;13, 2009 if the recipient remains employed by the Company
or a subsidiary until that date, and they are subject to acceleration in the event of a change of
control prior to that date as defined in the Company&#146;s 1996 Equity Compensation Plan. These
restricted stock grants to the executive officers,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">including the Chief Executive Officer, were made to provide a long-term incentive to these key
employees and to more closely align their interests with those of the Company&#146;s shareholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, we believe that the combination of salary, bonus and restricted stock received by
each of the executive officers for fiscal year 2005 was reasonable in view of that executive&#146;s
duties and responsibilities and his past and anticipated future contributions to the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a formal written charter that was most recently
approved and adopted by the Board on March&nbsp;12, 2004 and complies with the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers (the &#147;NASD&#148;). This charter is
reviewed annually by the Audit Committee to determine if any changes are necessary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the Audit Committee&#146;s charter and the independence criteria prescribed by
applicable law and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for audit
committee membership, all members of the Audit Committee are independent directors as defined in
NASD Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4200(a)(15). Each Audit Committee member meets the NASD&#146;s financial
knowledge requirements, and Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola and Engel, each of whom has been designated by the Board
as an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, meet the NASD&#146;s professional experience requirements as well.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of the Audit Committee are summarized on page 6 of this Proxy Statement under the
caption &#147;Matters Concerning Directors &#150; Committees and Meetings&#148; and are more fully set forth in
the charter of the Audit Committee that is included on the Company&#146;s Internet web site at
http://www.ktron.com. In particular, it is our duty to review the accounting and financial
reporting processes of the Company on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling our responsibilities, the
Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements to be
contained in the Company&#146;s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005
with the Company&#146;s management and also with Grant Thornton LLP, the Company&#146;s independent
registered public accounting firm. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the
reporting process, including the system of internal controls, and has represented to the Audit
Committee that such financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm is responsible
for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee has also discussed with Grant Thornton LLP the matters that are required
to be discussed by the auditors with the Audit Committee under Statement on Auditing Standards No.
61, as amended. Furthermore, the Audit Committee has received and discussed with the auditors
their annual written report on their independence from the Company and its management, which is
made under Rule&nbsp;3600T of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which adopts on an interim
basis Independence Standards Board Standard No.&nbsp;1 (independence discussions with audit committees),
and has considered with Grant Thornton LLP the compatibility of the provision by that firm of
non-audit services to the Company with the requirement of auditor independence.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts in an oversight capacity. The
Audit Committee reviews the Company&#146;s earnings releases before issuance and the annual report on
Form 10-K prior to filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In its oversight role, the
Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company&#146;s management, which has the
primary responsibility for financial statements and reports, and of the independent registered
public accountants, who, in their report, express an opinion on the conformity of the Company&#146;s
annual financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

assumes that $100 was invested at the end of fiscal year 2000 in the Common Stock, the Dow Jones
Wilshire, the Old Peer Group and the S&#038;P 500. Dividend reinvestment has been assumed and, with
respect to companies in the Dow Jones Wilshire and the Old Peer Group, the returns of such
companies have been weighted at each measurement point to reflect relative stock market
capitalization.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>General Requirements</U>. The Committee may grant SARs to an Employee or Non-Employee
Director separately or in tandem with any Option (for all or a portion of the applicable Option).
Tandem SARs may be granted either at the time the Option is granted or at any time thereafter while
the Option remains outstanding; provided, however, that, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option,
SARs may be granted only at the time of the Grant of the Incentive Stock Option. The Committee
shall establish the base amount of the SAR at the time the SAR is granted. The base amount of each
SAR shall be equal to the per share Exercise Price of the related Option or, if there is no related
Option, an amount equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of a share of Company Stock as of
the date of Grant of the SAR.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Tandem SARs</U>. In the case of tandem SARs, the number of SARs granted to a Grantee
that shall be exercisable during a specified period shall not exceed the number of shares of
Company Stock that the Grantee may purchase upon the exercise of the related Option during such
period. Upon the exercise of an Option, the SARs relating to the Company Stock covered by such
Option shall terminate. Upon the exercise of SARs, the related Option shall terminate to the
extent of an equal number of shares of Company Stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Exercisability</U>. An SAR shall be exercisable during the period specified by the
Committee in the Grant Instrument and shall be subject to such vesting and other restrictions as
may be specified in the Grant Instrument. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any
or all outstanding SARs at any time for any reason. SARs may only be exercised while the Grantee
is employed by, or providing service to, the Employer or during the applicable period after
termination of employment or service as described in Section 6(e) above.

federal (including FICA), state and local tax withholding requirements. The Employer may require
that the Grantee or other person receiving or exercising Grants pay to the Employer the amount of
any federal, state or local taxes that the Employer is required to withhold with respect to such
Grants, or the Employer may deduct from other wages paid by the Employer the amount of any
withholding taxes due with respect to such Grants.

rights except (i)&nbsp;by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to Grants

Option and the transferred Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as

determined by the Committee, in an amount equal to the amount by which the then Fair Market Value
of the shares of Company Stock subject to the Grantee&#146;s unexercised Options and SARs exceeds the
Exercise Price of the Options or the base amount of the SARs, as applicable, (ii)&nbsp;after giving
Grantees an opportunity to exercise their outstanding Options and SARs, terminate any or all
unexercised Options and SARs at such time as the Committee deems appropriate, or (iii)&nbsp;determine
that outstanding Options and SARs that are not exercised shall be assumed by, or replaced with
comparable options or rights by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the
surviving corporation). Such surrender or termination shall take place as of the date of the

unless the Grantee consents or unless the Committee acts under Section 19(f) below. The
termination of the Plan shall not impair the power and authority of the Committee with respect to
an outstanding Grant. Whether or not the Plan has terminated, an outstanding Grant may be
terminated or amended under Section 19(f) below or may be amended by agreement of the Company and
the Grantee consistent with the Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Grants in Connection with Corporate Transactions and Otherwise</U>. Nothing contained
in the Plan shall be construed to (i)&nbsp;limit the right of the Committee to make Grants under the
Plan in connection with the acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of
the business or assets of any corporation, firm or association, including Grants to employees
thereof who become Employees, or (ii)&nbsp;limit the right of the Company to grant stock options or make
other awards outside of the Plan. The Committee may make a Grant to an employee of another
corporation who becomes an Employee by reason of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of
stock or property, reorganization or liquidation involving the Company, in substitution for a stock
option or stock awards grant made by such corporation. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the
contrary, the Committee may establish such terms and conditions of the new Grants as it deems
appropriate, including setting the Exercise Price of Options or the base price of SARs at a price
necessary to retain for the Grantee the same economic value as the prior options or rights.

subject to all applicable laws and regulations, and to approvals by any governmental or regulatory
agency as may be required. With respect to persons subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act, it
is the intent of the Company that the Plan and all transactions under the Plan comply with all
applicable provisions of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. In addition, it is
the intent of the Company that Incentive Stock Options comply with the applicable provisions of
section 422 of the Code, that Grants of &#147;qualified performance-based compensation&#148; comply with the
applicable provisions of section 162(m) of the Code and that, to the extent applicable, Grants
comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any legal requirement
of section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422, 162(m) or 409A of the Code as set forth in the
Plan ceases to be required under section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422, 162(m) or 409A of
the Code, that Plan provision shall cease to apply. The Committee may revoke any Grant if it is
contrary to law or modify a Grant to bring it into compliance with any valid and mandatory
government regulation.

who are believed by the Committee to be subject to taxation in countries other than the United
States, the Committee may make Grants on such terms and conditions, consistent with the Plan, as
the Committee deems appropriate to comply with the laws of the applicable countries, and the
Committee may create such procedures, addenda and subplans and make such modifications as may be
necessary or advisable to comply with such laws.
