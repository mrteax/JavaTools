of the nominees named will not be a candidate or will be
unable to serve if elected.

On June 9, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors adopted
resolutions amending the Company's Stock Option Plan ("the
Plan"), in the following respects: the Plan is to be
administered by a committee consisting of not less than
three directors, all of whom shall be "disinterested
persons"; a committee member shall be a "disinterested
person" only if such person is not, at the time he exercises
discretion in administering the Plan, eligible, and has not
at any time within one year prior thereto been eligible, for
selection as a person as to whom options may be granted; and
no option may be granted to any director as to whom the
proxy statement for the meeting of stockholders at which the
plan was submitted for approval of the stockholders of the
Company disclosed that such director will not participate in
the Plan.

On December 5, 1996, a committee consisting of Arnold J.
Frankel, Stephen M. Goldstein and Samuel I. Hendler (Mr.
Arnold J. Frankel to be chairman of said committee) was
appointed by the Board of Directors to administer the Plan.
all of said directors were disinterested persons as defined
by the Plan.

On September 4, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors
adopted an amendment to the Plan; increasing by 250,000 the
number of shares of the Company's common stock with respect
to which stock options may be granted; extending the
termination date of the Plan to September 19, 2005; and
providing that transactions under the Plan be approved by
the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of
Directors that is comprised solely of two or more non-
employee directors.  The increase in the number of shares
with respect to which stock options may be granted and the
extension of the termination date is subject to ratification
by stockholders at this meeting.  (See, PROPOSAL TO RATIFY
AMENDMENT OF STOCK OPTION PLAN).

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose
members are Leonard S. Schwartz, Arnold J. Frankel, Robert
E. Parsont, and Samuel I. Hendler, functions as the
Executive Compensation Committee, and makes recommendations
to the Board with respect to the remuneration of the
Company's executive officers.

The Company's compensation policy has been designed to
enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate
executives whose enthusiasm and abilities will contribute to
the growth of its business and result in maximum
profitability to the Company and its stockholders, by
providing salaries and benefits competitive with those
offered by other companies in the chemical industry.  The
executive compensation program includes base salary, annual
incentive compensation (cash bonuses), and long term
incentive compensation (stock options).

Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the
chemical industry.  Because of the way that the Company
operates its business, the contributions of its executives
significantly affect corporate profitability.  Bonuses
(which can exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the
extent of such contributions. The Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) also is the President and Chief Operating Officer
(COO) of the Company.  The bonuses paid to the CEO and to
the Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO), reflect the Company's overall performance (excluding
extraordinary events such as a plant shut-down).

The three highest paid executives, other than the CEO and
CFO, are each responsible for the performance of one of the
Company's principal profit centers.  Internally generated
performance records are kept on a monthly and yearly basis
for these profit centers, and each center's profitability is
compared in the current year to the previous year.  Other
factors considered in determining the bonuses of individual
executives are the individual's own performance and the
overall performance of the Company.  The Executive
Compensation Committee determines each bonus primarily based
on this data, also taking into account the long term
contributions of each individual.

The Company's Stock Option Plan is administered by the Board
or a committee comprised solely of two or more non-employee
directors.  Grants of stock options, which vary according to
annual and longer term performance ratings, are made to
senior and middle management executives.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION

The CEO's compensation was determined not only on the basis
of the same factors utilized to compensate other executives,
but also on the basis of the additional duties and
responsibilities assumed by him.  Mr. Schwartz had been an
executive of the Company responsible for the performance of
one of its principal profit centers prior to his becoming
President and COO on July 1, 1996.  In addition to serving
in such capacities, as of July 1, 1997, he was appointed
Chairman of the Board and CEO.  Messrs. Frankel, Parsont and
Hendler took into account the compensation which in their
opinion the Company would have offered had it recruited
outside of the Company a person with his experience, skills
and talents to be Chairman, CEO and COO of the Company.
(Mr. Schwartz removed himself from participation in the
decision of the Executive Compensation Committee regarding
his compensation, although he did express to the Committee
his requests and views in the matter).

Director Compensation

Each non-employee director receives $7,500 per year for
serving on the Board of Directors plus $500 for each
committee meeting attended. There is no additional
compensation for directors who are also employees.

Employment Agreements

There are no employment contracts with any director, nominee
for election as director, or officer; however, Messrs.
Amitrano, Baldi, Brunner and Schwartz have signed patent and
trade secret agreements.

of the Company.

Robert E. Parsont, a director of the Company, retired from
his position as President and Chief Operating Officer of the
Company effective June 30, 1996.  The Board of Directors
authorized his being retained as a consultant for a period
of eighteen months, which was recently extended for another
twelve months, to December 31, 1998. He will be paid
$128,400 for consulting services during the current fiscal
year.

Arnold J. Frankel, a director of the Company, retired from
his position as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer effective June 30, 1997. The Board of Directors
authorized his being retained as a consultant for a period
of eighteen months. He will be paid $128,400 for consulting
services during the current fiscal year.

PROPOSAL TO RATIFY AMENDMENT OF STOCK OPTION PLAN

Stockholders will be asked to consider and ratify an
amendment of the Aceto Corporation 1980 Stock Option Plan
("1980 Stock Option Plan"), which amendment was adopted by
the Company's Board of Directors on September 4, 1997,
subject to ratification by the stockholders at the Annual
Meeting (as amended the 1980 Stock Option Plan is referred
to herein as the "Amended Plan").  The Amended Plan
increases by 250,000 the number of shares of the Company's
common stock with respect to which stock options may be
granted; extends the termination date to September 19, 2005
and provides that transactions under the Plan be approved by
the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of
Directors that is comprised solely of two or more non-
employee directors (the provision that transactions under
the plan be approved by the Board of Directors or Committee
of the Board of Directors that is comprised solely of two or
more non-employee directors does not require ratification by
stockholders).  As of September 4, 1997 options to purchase
8,635 shares of common stock remained available for grant
pursuant to the terms of the 1980 Stock Option Plan.  The
Board of Directors believes that the 1980 Stock Option Plan
has contributed significantly to the success of the Company
by enabling the Company to attract and retain upper
management personnel of outstanding ability and that the
amount of shares remaining for grant thereunder is
inadequate for future requirements.

If the stockholders do not ratify the increase in the number
of shares with respect to which options may be granted or
the extension of the termination date, such provisions shall
be without further force and effect, no options additional
to those authorized under the 1980 Stock Option Plan will be
granted, and the 1980 Stock Option Plan as amended and
restated in 1990 will remain in effect.

If the Amendment to the Plan is ratified by stockholders,
the voting power of the stockholders (as is the case with
any stock option plan) may be diluted in the event that
options granted under the Amended Plan are exercised.

Summary of amended Plan

The Amended Plan permits the issuance of options to purchase
an aggregate of up to 650,000 shares of common stock (an
increase of 250,000 over the 1980 Stock Option Plan, as
amended in 1990).  If the Amendment is ratified, options to
purchase 258,635 shares of common stock would be available
for grant pursuant to the terms thereof.  The options may be
issued on or prior to September 19, 2005 to officers and
other key employees.  A director, as such, shall not be
considered an officer or employee for purposes of the
Amended Plan, but a person otherwise eligible to participate
in the plan is not disqualified because he is a director of
the Company.  No option however may be granted to any person
who owns, at the time an option is granted to such person,
more than 10% of the then outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock.

Administration of the Amended Plan

The Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") is authorized
to administer the Amended Plan. Transactions under the
Amended Plan must be approved by the Board or a committee of
the Board comprised solely of two or more non-employee
directors, which transactions include the persons to whom
options are granted, the exercise price of options granted,
the period during which options will be exercisable, and the
number of shares subject to each option.

Securities Subject to Amended Plan

The Amended Plan covers a maximum of 650,000 authorized
shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in the event
of changes in the outstanding common stock by reason of
stock dividends, stock splits, stock distributions,
recapitalizations or the like.  Upon the termination or
expiration of an unexercised option, in whole or in part,
the number of shares subject to the unexercised option will
become available again for allocation under the Amended
Plan.

The market value (bid price) of the Company's common stock
as of September 4, 1997 was $18.00 per share.

Description of Options

The per share exercise price of any option may be greater
than or less than the market value of the stock on the date
the option is granted.

Each option granted shall become exercisable at such time,
or in installments at such times, as may be provided
therein.  To the extent that any installment of an option
has become exercisable it may be exercised thereafter, in
whole at any time or from time to time in part, until the
option or that installment terminates.

An option shall be exercisable by written notice of
exercise, in the form prescribed by the Board, delivered to
the Company, in such manner as the Board may designate.  The
notice shall specify the number of shares for which the
option is being exercised (which number, if less than all of
the shares then subject to exercise, shall not be less than
such number as the Board may designate) and shall be
accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price of such
shares.

Upon any exercise of an option, the Company may, in the
discretion of the Board, offer to lend to the person
exercising the option all or any part of the purchase price
of the shares to be purchased upon exercise of the option,
the loan to be on such terms (including the rate of
interest, the repayment schedule and the security, if any)
as the Board may determine.

Upon any exercise of an option, the Company may, in the
discretion of the Board, permit the person exercising the
option to make all or any portion of such payment in kind by
the delivery of shares of the Company's common stock having
a fair market value, on the date of delivery, equal to the
portion of the option price so paid.

Each option, to the extent it has not theretofore been
exercised, shall terminate upon the termination of the
optionee's employment for any reason, except that if the
optionee's employment ceases by reason of his death, his
option may be exercised (by the person or persons to whom
his rights under the option pass by his will or by the laws
of descent and distribution) at any time within 90 days
after his death for the lesser of (i) that number of shares
which the optionee was entitled to purchase at the time of
his death or (ii) that number of shares for which the option
would have been exercisable on the date of exercise had the
optionee's employment not been terminated.

Options are not transferable except upon the death of the
optionee.

Duration and Modification of Amended Plan

The Amended Plan will terminate not later than September 19,
2005.  The Board may at any time suspend or terminate the
Amended Plan and may amend it from time to time in such
respects as the Board may deem advisable in order to conform
to any change in the law, or in any other respect which the
Board may deem to be in the best interest of the Company;
provided,however, that without the approval of the
stockholders of the Company no such amendment shall (a)
except for adjustments upon changes in stock set forth in
the following paragraph, increase the maximum number of
shares for which options may be granted under the Amended
Plan, or (b) change the provisions thereof relating to
eligibility.

Adjustments Upon Changes in Stock

Each option shall contain such provisions as the Board may
determine to be appropriate for the adjustment of the kind
and number of shares subject to the option, or the option
price, or both, in the event of any changes in the
outstanding common stock of the Company by reason of stock
dividends, stock splits, stock distributions,
recapitalizations, reorganization, mergers, consolidations,
sales or exchanges of assets, combinations or exchange of
shares, or the like.  In the event of any such change in the
outstanding common stock, the kind and aggregate number of
shares of stock subject to the Amended Plan shall be
adjusted if and to the extent determined appropriate by the
Board, whose determination shall be conclusive.

Federal Income Tax Consequences of Issuance and Exercise of
Options

The following discussion of the Federal income tax
consequences of granting and exercise of options under the
Amended Plan, and the sale of common stock acquired as a
result thereof, is based on an analysis of the Code, as
currently in effect, existing laws, judicial decisions and
administrative rulings and regulations, all of which are
subject to change.  Each optionee must consult his or her
personal tax advisor to determine the taxes applicable to
the issuance, exercise and sale of options.

No income will be recognized by an optionee at the time a
stock option under the Amended Plan is granted.  Ordinary
income will be recognized by an optionee at the time an
option is exercised, and the amount of such income will be
equal to the excess of the fair market value on the exercise
date of the shares issued to the optionee over the option
price.  This ordinary income will also constitute wages
subject to the withholding of the income tax and the Company
will be required to be withheld is available for
withholding, in cash.  An optionee's holding period with
respect to the shares acquired will begin on the date of the
exercise of the stock options.

The tax basis of the stock acquired upon the exercise of a
stock option will be equal to the sum of (a) the exercise
price of such stock option and (b) the amount included in
income of the exercise of such option.  Gain or loss on a
subsequent sale or other disposition of the stock will be
measured by the difference between the amount realized on
the disposition and the tax basis of such shares.

If an optionee is permitted to, and does, make the required
payment of the option price by delivering shares of common
stock the optionee generally will not recognize any gain as
a result of such delivery, but the amount of gain, if any,
which is not so recognized will be excluded from his or her
basis in the new shares received.  In such a case, an
optionee's holding period in the shares received will be
determined by reference to his or her holding period in the
shares of common stock exchanged.

The Company will be entitled to a deduction for Federal
income tax purposes in the same amount as the amount
included in income by the optionee with respect to his or
her stock option, subject to the usual rules as to
reasonableness of compensation and provided that suitable
arrangements are made to collect and pay over applicable
withholding tax from the optionee.  The deduction will be
allowed for the taxable year of the Company in which the
exercise of the option occurs.

Recommendation and Vote Required

The Board of Directors believes that ratification of the
amendment of the 1980 Stock Option Plan is in the best
interests of the Company and all stockholders and recommends
a vote FOR the ratification of the amendment.  Ratification
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of the voting stock.  Proxies
received in response to this solicitation will be voted FOR
the ratification of the amendment of the 1980 Stock Option
Plan unless otherwise specified in the proxy.

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
requires the Company's directors and executive officers, and
persons who own more than 10% of the registered class of the
Company's equity securities to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), initial reports of
ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common
stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers,
directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by
SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all
Section 16(a) forms they file. To the Company's knowledge,
based solely on review of the copies of such reports
furnished to the Company and representations that no other
reports were required during the fiscal year, all Section
16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers,
directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were
complied with.

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP was the Company's principal accountant
for the Company's most recent fiscal year ended June 30,
1997. Representatives of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP are expected
to be present at the Stockholders' Meeting with an
opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so.
Such representatives are also expected to be available to
respond to appropriate questions.

The Company has not as yet selected its principal accountant
for its current fiscal year since such selection is usually
made by the Company's Board of Directors late in the fiscal
year. At present, management has no reason to believe that
there will be any change in its principal accountant for the
current fiscal year.


STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Any proposal which a stockholder intends to present at the
1998 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be duly received by
the Company on or before June 12, 1998.

OTHER MATTERS

The Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year
ended June 30, 1997 is being mailed to stockholders with
this Proxy Statement.

The cost of solicitation of proxies in the accompanying form
will be borne by the Company, including expenses in
connection with preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement.
In addition to the use of mails, proxies may be solicited by
personal interview, facsimile, telephone or telegram by
directors, officers and employees of the Company.
Arrangements may also be made with brokerage houses and
other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the
forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners
of stock held of record by such persons, and the Company may
reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection therewith.

The management does not know of any matters to be presented

Notice of Annual Meeting, but if other matters are
presented, it is the intention of the persons named in the
accompanying proxy to vote on such matters in accordance
with their judgment.

The Company will provide, without charge to each person
whose proxy is solicited, on the written request of any such
person, a copy of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K
for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1997 required to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the
financial statements and the schedules thereto. Such written
request should be directed to Mr. Donald Horowitz, Aceto
Corporation, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New York 11042-
1215. Each such request must set forth a good faith
representation that, as of September 19, 1997 the person
making the request was a beneficial owner of securities
entitled to vote at the annual meeting of stockholders.

EXHIBIT A

ACETO CORPORATION
STOCK OPTION PLAN
(as Amended and Restated effective as of September 4, 1997)

1.   Purpose

     The Aceto Corporation Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is
     intended to give to officers and other key employees of
     Aceto Corporation (the "Company") an increased incentive
     to promote the success of the Company by affording them
     an opportunity to purchase stock in the Company pursuant
     to stock options.

2.   Number of Shares

     Options may be granted by the Company from time to time
     under the Plan to one or more persons falling within
     the class of employees specified in Paragraph 4 hereof to
     purchase an aggregate of 650,000 shares of the
     Company's common stock, $.01 par value, subject to
     adjustment as provided in paragraph 8.  The shares
     available for options to be granted under the Plan may
     consist either in whole or in part of shares of the
     Company's authorized but unissued common stock or shares
     of the Company's authorized and issued common stock
     reacquired by the Company and held in its treasury, as
     may from time to time be determined by the Board of
     Directors (the "Board").  If any option granted under the
     plan expires or terminates for any reason, in whole or
     in part, without having been exercised, the number of
     shares subject to that option or part shall be
     available for further options pursuant to the Plan.

3.   Administration

     The Plan shall be administered by the Board, or a 
     committee appointed by the Board that is comprised
     solely of two or more non-employee directors, which shall
     have full authority, subject to the provisions of the Plan,
     (i) to determine, in its discretion, the individuals to
     whom, and the times at which, options shall be granted,
     the number of shares covered by each option, the option
     price, and the other terms and provisions of the
     respective option agreements (which need not be identical),
     including provisions concerning the time or times when, and
     the extent to which, the options may be exercised, (ii) to
     adopt rules and regulations relating to the Plan, (iii)
     to interpret the Plan and the option agreements, and (iv)
     to make all other determinations and to take all other
     action necessary or advisable for the administration of
     the Plan.  All such determination and actions shall be
     final and conclusive for all purposes and upon all
     persons.

4.   Eligibility

     Officers and other key employees of the Company or any
     subsidiary of the Company shall be eligible to receive
     an option or options hereunder.  A director, as such,
     shall not be considered an officer or employee for
     purposes of the Plan, but a person otherwise eligible
     to participate in the Plan shall not be disqualified
     because he is a director of the Company or any
     subsidiary.  More than one option may be granted to any
     eligible person.  No option may be granted to any person
     who owns, at the time an option is granted to him, more
     than 10% of the then outstanding shares of the Company's
     common stock.  As used herein, the term "subsidiary"
     means any corporation of which stock possessing 50% or
     more of the total combined voting power of all classes of
     stock is owned directly by the Company or by any one of
     its subsidiaries (as defined in this sentence).

5.   Option Price; Date of Option

     (a)  The option price shall be determined by the Board,
          and may be greater than or less than the market
          value of the stock on the date the option is
          granted.

     (b)  The date of the granting of an option under the
          Plan shall be the date on which such option
          shall be duly executed by or on behalf of the
          Company.

6.   Exercise of Option

     (a)  Each option granted under the Plan shall become
          exercisable at such time, or in installments at such
          times, as may be provided therein.  To the
          extent that any installment of an option has become
          exercisable it may be exercised thereafter, in whole 
          or at any time or from time to time in part, until 
          the option or that installment terminates.  An option 
          may be exercised only during the continuance of the
          optionee's employment, except as provided in paragraph 7
          with respect to termination of optionee's employment on his
          death.  As used herein, the term "optionee's employment"
          shall mean the employment of the optionee by the Company or
          by a subsidiary.

     (b)  An option shall be exercised by written notice of
          exercise in the form prescribed by the Board,
          delivered to the Company, in such manner as the
          Board may designate.  The notice shall specify
          the number of shares for which the option is
          being exercised (which number, if less than all of
          the shares then subject to exercise, shall not be less than
          such number as the Board may designate) and shall
          be accompanied by payment in full of the
          purchase price of such shares.

     (c)  Upon any exercise of an option, the Company may,
          in the discretion of the Board, offer to lend
          to the person exercising the option all or
          any part of the purchase price of the shares to be
          purchased upon exercise of the option, the loan
          to be on such terms (including the rate of
          interest, the repayment schedule and the security, if any)
          as the Board may determine.

     (d)  Upon any exercise of an option, the Company may,
          in the discretion of the Board, permit the
          person exercising the option to make all or any
          portion of such payment in kind by the delivery of
          shares of the Common Stock having a fair
          market value, on the date of delivery, equal to the portion
          of the price so paid.

     (e)  No shares shall be delivered upon exercise of any
          option until all laws, rules and regulations
          which the Board may deem applicable have been
          complied with.  If a registration statement under the
          Securities Act of 1933 is not then in effect
          with respect to the shares issuable upon such
          exercise, the person exercising the option must give to the
          Company a written representation and undertaking,
          satisfactory in form and substance to the Board, that he is
          acquiring the shares for his own account for investment and
          not with a view to the distribution thereof; in such case
          the certificates for the shares shall bear an appropriate
          legend.

     (f)  The person exercising an option shall not be
          considered a recordholder of the stock so
          purchased for any purchase until the date on
          which he is actually recorded as the holder of
          such stock upon the stock records of the Company.

7.   Termination of Option

     Each option, to the extent is has not theretofore been
     exercised, shall terminate upon the termination of the
     optionee's employment for any reason, except that if the
     optionee's employment ceases by reason of his death, his
     option may be exercised (by the person or persons to whom
     his rights under the option pass by his will or by the
     laws of descent and distribution) at any time within 90 days
     after his death, for the lesser of (i) that number of shares
     which the optionee was entitled to purchase at the time
     of his death or (ii) that number of shares for which the
     option would have been exercisable on the date of exercise
     had the optionee's employment not terminated.  An
     optionee's employment shall not be deemed to have
     ceased by reason of the transfer of his employment, without
     interruption of service, between or among the Company and
     any subsidiary of the Company.

8.   Adjustments Upon Changes in Stock

     Each option agreement shall contain such provisions as
     the Board may determine to be appropriate for the
     adjustment of the kind and number of shares subject to
     the option, or the option price or both, in the event
     of any changes in the outstanding common stock of the
     Company by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, stock
     distributions, recapitilizations, reorganization, mergers,
     consolidations, sales or exchanges of assets, combinations
     or exchanges of shares, or the like.  In the event of any
     such change in the outstanding common stock, the kind and
     aggregate number of shares of stock subject to the Plan
     shall be adjusted if and to the extent determined
     appropriate by the Board whose determination shall be
     conclusive.

9.   Non-Transferability of Options

     Any option granted under the Plan may not be
     transferred and, during the lifetime of the employee to
     whom granted, may be exercised only by him.

10.  No Right to Employment

     Nothing in the Plan or in any option granted pursuant
     to the Plan shall confer upon any officer or employee any
     right to continue in the employ of the Company or of any
     of its subsidiaries or shall interfere in any way with the
     right of the Company or any such subsidiary to terminate
     his employment with or without cause.

11.  Amendment, Suspension, Expiration and Termination of Plan

     The Board may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan
     and may amend it from time to time in such respects as the
     Board may deem advisable in order to conform to any
     change in the law or in any other respect which the Board
     may deem to be in the best interests of the Company;
     provided, however, that without the approval of the
     stockholders of the Company no such amendment shall (a)
     except as specified in paragraph 8, increase the maximum
     number of shares for which options may be granted under
     the Plan, or (b) change the provisions of paragraph 4
     relating to eligibility.

     The Plan shall terminate on September 19, 2005 or at
     any such earlier time as the Board may determine.  Options
     may be granted under the Plan at any time and from time
     to time prior to its termination.  Any option
     outstanding under the Plan at the time of the termination
     of the Plan shall remain in effect until such
     option shall have been exercised or shall have expired in
     accordance with its terms.

12.  Stockholder Approval

     The Plan as Amended and Restated shall become effective
     upon its  adoption by the Board but if the Amendment is not
     ratified by the stockholders of the Company within
     twelve months after its adoption by the Board the Plan and
     any options granted thereunder subsequent to September
     4, 1997 shall become void.
