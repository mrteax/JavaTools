                         ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                             TO BE HELD MAY 17, 2002

                               -------------------


         This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the shareholders of K-Tron
International, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders of the Company to be held on May 17, 2002 and any postponements or
adjournments thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the
enclosed Proxy Card are being mailed to shareholders on or about April 1, 2002.

         Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card are being solicited by
and on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for the purposes set
forth in the foregoing notice of meeting. The costs incidental to the
solicitation and obtaining of proxies, including the cost of reimbursing banks
and brokers for forwarding proxy materials to their principals, will be borne by
the Company. Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by officers
and employees of the Company by mail, telephone, telefax, personal interviews
and other methods of communication.

         The Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December
29, 2001, including consolidated financial statements and other information with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, is being mailed to shareholders
with this Proxy Statement. Such Annual Report is not part of this Proxy
Statement.

                              VOTING AT THE MEETING

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED; PROXIES

         Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2002
are entitled to notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting.
As of that date, the Company had outstanding 2,432,092 shares of Common Stock.
The holders of a majority of such shares, represented in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is necessary before
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting except that, even if a quorum
is not present, the shareholders present in person or by proxy shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Each
shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to one vote for each share of
Common Stock outstanding in such shareholder's name.

         The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed Proxy
Card will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the
shareholder signing such Proxy Card. The Proxy Card provides space for a
shareholder to vote for the nominee, or to withhold authority to vote for the
nominee, for the Board of Directors. The nominee for election as a director is
to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. With
respect to any other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual
Meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders
entitled to vote thereon is required to take action, unless a greater percentage
is required either by law or by the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws. In determining the number of votes cast with respect
to any voting matter, only those cast "for" or
<PAGE>
"against" are included. Abstentions will be considered present and entitled to
vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly,
abstentions will have no effect on the vote. Similarly, where brokers submit
proxies but are prohibited and thus refrain from exercising discretionary
authority in voting shares on certain matters for beneficial owners who have not
provided voting instructions with respect to such matters (commonly referred to
as "broker non-votes"), those shares will be considered present and entitled to
vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be counted as votes cast as to such
matters and thus will have no effect on the vote.

         If a signed Proxy Card is returned and the shareholder has given no
direction with respect to a voting matter, the shares will be voted with respect
to that matter by the proxy agents as recommended by the Board of Directors or
its Executive Committee. Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card will
not affect a shareholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in
person. Any shareholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it by giving
notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time before the
proxy is voted.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

         The following table sets forth certain information as of March 12, 2002
(or as of such other date or dates as may be noted below) with respect to shares
of Common Stock of the Company beneficially owned by each director, by each
executive officer of the Company named in the Summary Compensation Table under
"Executive Compensation," by all current directors and executive officers of the
Company as a group and by each person believed by the Company to be the
beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.
Except as indicated below, the Company understands that the shareholders listed
in such table have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares
owned by them. The number of shares in the table below includes shares issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding stock options to the extent that such options
are exercisable by the director, executive officer or shareholder on or within
60 days after March 12, 2002. In the case of directors and executive officers,
the information below has been provided by such persons at the request of the
Company.

                          MATTERS CONCERNING DIRECTORS

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

         The Board of Directors currently consists of five directors and is
classified with respect to terms of office into four classes. The Class I
director elected at the Annual Meeting will serve until the 2006 annual meeting
of shareholders and until such director's successor has been elected and
qualified, except in the event of such director's earlier death, resignation or
removal. The terms of office of the Class II, Class III and Class IV directors
will expire at the annual meetings to be held in 2003, 2004 and 2005,
respectively, upon the election and qualification of their successors.

         The Board of Directors has nominated Mr. Edward T. Hurd for election as
the Class I director. Mr. Hurd currently is a director of the Company. The
persons named as proxy agents in the enclosed Proxy Card intend (unless
instructed otherwise by a shareholder) to vote for the election of Mr. Edward T.
Hurd as the Class I director. In the event that the nominee should become unable
to accept nomination or election (a circumstance which the Board of Directors
does not expect), the proxy agents intend to vote for any alternate nominee
designated by the Board of Directors or its Executive Committee or, in the
discretion of the Board or its Executive Committee, the position may be left
vacant.

         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE CLASS I
NOMINEE.

         Set forth below is certain information with respect to the nominee for
director and each other person currently serving as a director of the Company
whose term of office will continue after the Annual Meeting, including the class
and term of office of each such person. This information has been provided by
each director at the request of the Company.

         Class I--Nominee for Term Continuing until 2006

         EDWARD T. HURD. Mr. Hurd has been a director since January 2002 when he
was elected by unanimous vote of the directors in office to fill a vacancy in
Class I. Mr. Hurd is a principal in three consulting firms: Hurd Consulting,
focusing on high technology business management (1996 to present); Curry and
Hurd, specializing in acquisitions and divestitures and the management of
distressed businesses (2000 to present); and Customer Valunomics, which

COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS

         The Board of Directors has an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee
and a Compensation and Human Resources Committee. The members of the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee also constitute the members of the
two committees which administer the Company's employee stock option plans
(collectively, the "Stock Option Committee"). During fiscal year 2001, the Board
of Directors held four meetings, the Executive Committee held one joint meeting
with the Compensation and Human Resources Committee by telephone conference, the
Audit Committee held four meetings (including one by telephone conference), the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee held four meetings (including one
joint meeting with the Executive Committee by telephone conference) and the
Stock Option Committee did not meet separately from the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the
fiscal year 2001 meetings of the Board of Directors and of the Board committee
or committees on which he served during the year. The Company had a Nominating
Committee until the death of one its members during 2001; since that time, the
full Board of Directors has assumed the responsibilities of the Nominating
Committee.

         The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of the
Board of Directors, except action on dividends and certain other matters which
cannot by law be delegated by the Board, during the periods between regular
Board meetings. The primary duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee
are to serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the Company's
financial reporting process and internal control systems, review the
independence and performance of the Company's independent accountants, and
provide an open avenue of communication among the independent accountants,
financial and senior management of the Company and the Board. The Compensation
and Human Resources Committee recommends to the Board the compensation of the
Company's chief executive officer, reviews and takes action on the chief
executive officer's recommendations regarding the appropriate compensation of
the Company's other executive officers and also of any other direct reports to
the chief executive officer, approves the granting of any bonuses to such
officers and direct reports and the total size of any Company-wide bonus pool,
reviews other compensation and personnel development matters generally and
recommends to the Board the compensation of non-employee directors. The
Nominating Committee's principal duties, which have been assumed by the full
Board as indicated above, are to recommend to the Board nominees for election as
directors, changes in the membership of the committees of the Board and the
membership of any newly-created Board committee. The Stock Option Committee is
responsible for administering the Company's 1996 Equity Compensation Plan and
another stock option plan which has expired (but under which there remain
outstanding stock options).

         The current members of the Executive Committee are Messrs. Cloues
(Chairman) and Cohen; of the Audit Committee, Messrs. Pinola (Chairman), Engel
and Hurd; of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee,

                                      -5-

Messrs. Cohen (Chairman) and Pinola; and of the Stock Option Committee, Messrs.
Cohen and Pinola.

STANDARD COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

         Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual
retainer of $12,500, a $2,000 annual retainer for each membership on any of the
Audit Committee and the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, a $1,000
annual retainer for membership on the Executive Committee, $1,000 for each Board
meeting attended and $750 for each Executive Committee meeting attended provided
that, in the case of Executive Committee meetings, such meetings either require
substantial preparation or last two hours or more. In addition, the chairman of
the Audit Committee and the chairman of the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee are each paid an additional $1,500 for their service in such
capacities. All retainers are paid on a prorated bi-monthly basis. Directors
generally do not receive compensation for their participation in telephone
meetings or for attendance at other committee meetings. Under the 1996 Equity
Compensation Plan, non-employee directors are eligible to receive stock options
and, unless the Stock Option Committee determines otherwise (which has not been
the case in the past), on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders of the
Company, each non-employee director receives a stock option grant to purchase
1,000 shares of Common Stock with an option price per share equal to the fair
market value of a share of Common Stock on that date. Such options are fully
vested on the date of grant and have a ten-year term.

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE

         Each non-employee director is required to own shares of Company Common
Stock with a value, at the greater of cost or market, equal to four times the
current $12,500 annual retainer, or $50,000. As for any newly-elected director,
this requirement may be phased in over a period of time to be determined by the
Board. All directors are in compliance with this guideline with the exception of
the two most recently-elected directors, Messrs. Engel and Hurd, who as of March
12, 2002 owned 2,500 shares and 1,000 shares, respectively.

REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF NOMINATIONS

         Article Ninth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company provides that no person may be nominated for election as a director by a
shareholder at an annual or special meeting unless written notice of such
shareholder's intent to make such nomination has been given, either by personal
delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the
Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than (i)
with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, 90
days in advance of such meeting and (ii) with respect to an election to be held
at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the close of
business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting
is first given to shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name
and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the
person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the shareholder is
a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or
understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or
nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d) such other information
regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be
included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended
to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e) the consent of each nominee
to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. The Board of Directors may,
in its discretion, consider nominees for the Board recommended by a shareholder
according the foregoing procedure, but it is not obligated to do so, and the
chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person
not made in compliance with such procedure.

CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

         Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt were employed by the Company or a
subsidiary during fiscal year 2001 under employment agreements with the Company
(the "Employment Agreements"). Under the Employment Agreements, Messrs. Bowen,
Remick and Guenthardt are entitled to receive a base salary, which may be
increased from time to time, and such additional compensation and bonus payments
as may be awarded to them. During fiscal year 2001, the annual base salaries for
Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt were $210,000, $191,000 and $185,500,
respectively. There have been no changes in these salaries since the beginning
of 2001. The Company's obligation to pay such base salaries is subject to its
right to reduce them in the event reductions are generally being made for other
officers of the Company or its subsidiaries holding comparable positions.

         Under Mr. Remick's employment agreement, he received a stock option
grant to purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock on May 10, 2001, the second
anniversary of the commencement of his employment with the Company, at a
purchase price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, with the
option for 1,250 of such shares to vest on each of the first, second, third and
fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.

         Each of the Employment Agreements provides that either the Company or
the employee may terminate the employment term thereunder upon not less than one
year's prior notice. Such employment terms are also subject to termination by
reason of the employee's death or disability or by the Board of Directors at any
time for "cause" as specified in the Employment Agreements. In addition, the
Company has the right to terminate any of Messrs. Bowen, Remick or Guenthardt at
any time without cause by paying him a lump sum amount equal to 100% of his
then-annual base salary or, if the previously described one-year notice of
termination has already been given by the Company to him, the portion thereof
relating to the balance of the employment term.

         Mr. Cloues was employed by the Company during fiscal year 2001 under an
employment agreement with the Company pursuant to which he served as the
Company's Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. During
fiscal year 2001, Mr. Cloues' annual base salary was $436,800, and there has
been no change in his salary since the beginning of 2001.


                                      -10-
<PAGE>
         Mr. Cloues' employment agreement provides that he can terminate the
agreement upon not less than 90 days' prior notice. The Company may terminate
the employment term without cause upon not less than 30 days' prior written
notice to Mr. Cloues, in which case Mr. Cloues would be entitled to a lump sum
payment equal to 200% of his then-annual base salary. Mr. Cloues' employment
term is also subject to termination by reason of his death or disability or by
the Board of Directors at any time for "cause" as specified in his employment
agreement.

         Mr. Cloues' employment agreement also includes provisions relating to a
termination of employment upon a "change of control" (as specified in his
employment agreement). Mr. Cloues' employment agreement applies to a termination
of employment upon or within one year after a "change of control" which, if such
termination was initiated by the Company or any successor thereto, was for any
reason other than death, disability or "cause" or which, if such termination was
initiated by Mr. Cloues, was at his sole discretion without regard to reason. In
the event of the termination of employment of Mr. Cloues upon a "change of
control," his employment agreement provides that, subject to certain
limitations, the Company would pay him (i) an amount equal to three times his
annual base salary in effect either immediately prior to the termination of
employment or immediately prior to the "change of control," whichever is higher,
and (ii) unless Mr. Cloues notifies the Company in writing that he intends to
retain his options, an amount equal to the spread (the excess of market value
over exercise price) on any stock options then held by him, whether or not such
options were exercisable at the date of termination.

         NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, THE FOLLOWING REPORTS OF THE
         COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
         AND THE PERFORMANCE GRAPH ON PAGE 14 SHALL NOT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED
         BY REFERENCE BY ANY GENERAL STATEMENT INCORPORATING BY REFERENCE THIS
         PROXY STATEMENT INTO ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
         AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED,
         EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY INCORPORATES THIS
         INFORMATION BY REFERENCE, AND SHALL NOT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED FILED UNDER
         SUCH ACTS.

                           REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION
                          AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE

         As members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the
"Compensation Committee"), it is our duty to review the compensation paid to the
Company's executive officers and the other benefits received by them, to
recommend to the Board the annual base salary of the Company's Chief Executive
Officer, to approve the annual base salaries of the other executive officers, to
approve all bonuses and other material compensation granted to the Chief
Executive Officer and other executive officers and to approve the total amount
of all bonuses paid by the Company under any Company-wide bonus or incentive
compensation program. In addition, we also constitute the committee (the "Stock
Option Committee") which administers the Company's 1996 Equity Compensation Plan
and thus are responsible for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
rights and restricted stock to officers and other employees of the Company.
These duties and the other responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are
more fully described on page 5 of this Proxy Statement under the caption
"Matters Concerning Directors - Committees and Meetings." In fulfilling these
duties and responsibilities, it is the Compensation Committee's goal to have a
policy that will enable the Company to attract, retain and reward senior
officers who contribute to both its short-term and long-term success. Both
members of the Compensation Committee are non-employee, independent directors.

         The Company's compensation policy for executive officers is to pay
competitively and to be fair and equitable in the administration of pay. This is
the same policy applicable to all employees of the Company. The Company seeks to
balance the compensation paid to a particular individual with the compensation
paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside the Company
and at other similar companies.

         The granting of bonuses on an annual basis is subjective and is based
on a number of factors, including both the individual's performance and the
financial performance of the Company and its various business units during the
fiscal year, and the Compensation Committee determined, upon the recommendation
of the Chief Executive Officer, that no cash bonuses would be paid for fiscal
year 2001. With respect to stock awards, in July 2001, the Compensation
Committee granted to Messrs. Cloues, Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt options to
purchase

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
40,000, 20,000, 20,000 and 20,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively. Each of
these grants vests in total on the fifth anniversary of the date of the grant.
At the same time, the Compensation Committee granted five additional employees
of the Company options to purchase an aggregate of 21,000 shares of Common
Stock. Each of these grants vests in four equal, annual installments over a four
year period, commencing July 20, 2002 and ending July 20, 2005. In July 2001,
the Compensation Committee also granted Messrs. Cloues, Bowen, Remick and
Guenthardt 4,000, 2,000, 2,000 and 2,000 shares of restricted Common Stock,
respectively. Each of these grants of restricted Common Stock will vest on
November 1, 2002, if such individual is employed by the Company on that date.
The option grants to the key employees, including the Named Executive Officers,
and the restricted stock grants to the Named Executive Officers were granted to
provide a long-term incentive to the Company's key employees and to more closely
align the interests of these employees with the interests of the Company's
shareholders. Also, pursuant to Mr. Remick's employment agreement, he was
granted in May 2001, on the second anniversary of the commencement of his
employment with the Company, an option to purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock,
with the option for 1,250 of such shares to vest on each of the first, second,
third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. All of the options referred
to above were granted at a purchase price equal to the fair market value of the
Company's Common Stock on the date of grant.

         The Compensation Committee has not adopted or made any recommendation
to the Board regarding a bonus or other incentive compensation program for 2002.
Whether or not any such program is adopted or recommended, it is expected that
future stock options will be granted by the Stock Option Committee on a
case-by-case basis, as and when deemed appropriate, rather than as part of any
incentive compensation program.

         As with bonuses, the decisions of the Compensation Committee regarding
salaries are subjective and not based on any list of specific criteria. The
Company's Chief Executive Officer, Edward B. Cloues, II, had a 2001 base salary
of $436,800. The annual base salaries of the other three Named Executive
Officers during fiscal year 2001 were as follows: Mr. Bowen, $210,000; Mr.
Remick, $191,000 and Mr. Guenthardt, $185,500. The Compensation Committee
accepted the Chief Executive Officer's recommendation that his salary, along
with the salaries of Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt and the other
employees of the Company, not be increased for at least the first six months of
fiscal year 2002 except, in the case of other employees, for promotions or other
exceptional circumstances.

         In summary, we believe that the salaries received by each of the Named
Executive Officers for fiscal year 2001 were reasonable in view of their past
and anticipated future contributions to the Company and that the equity grants
were similarly justified and provide a long-term incentive to each of the Named
Executive Officers.

                          REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

         The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a formal written charter
approved and adopted by the Board of Directors on May 15, 2000. In accordance
with the charter, all the members of the Audit Committee are independent, and
the Audit Committee reviewed the adequacy of the charter during fiscal year
2001.

         The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process
on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee has
reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements to be contained in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2001
with the Company's management and also with Arthur Andersen LLP, the Company's
independent accountants and auditors. Management is responsible for the
financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal
controls, and has represented to the Audit Committee that such financial
statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The independent accountants are responsible for expressing an
opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.


                                      -12-
<PAGE>
         The Audit Committee has discussed with Arthur Andersen LLP the matters
required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended.
Furthermore, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the
letter from Arthur Andersen LLP required by Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), and the Audit
Committee has discussed with Arthur Andersen LLP that firm's independence from
the Company and its management.

AUDIT FEES

         The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Arthur
Andersen LLP for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for the
year ended December 29, 2001 and the reviews of the Company's financial
statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the year
ended December 29, 2001 were $185,000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

         There were no fees billed for the professional services rendered by
Arthur Andersen LLP during fiscal year 2001 relating to financial information
systems design and implementation.

ALL OTHER FEES

         The aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered by Arthur
Andersen LLP during fiscal year 2001, other than the services referred to above
under the captions "Audit Fees" and "Financial Information Systems Design and
Implementation Fees," were $101,000, and such other fees were primarily related
to preparation of the Company's U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign income tax
returns and to tax advice given to the Company.

         After considering the provision of services encompassed within the
above disclosures about fees (under the captions "Financial Information Systems
Design and Implementation Fees" and "All Other Fees"), the Audit Committee has
determined that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining
Arthur Andersen LLP's independence.

         Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit
Committee has recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Company's
audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2001 to be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

         The following line graph compares the yearly change in the cumulative
total shareholder return on the Company's Common Stock for the past five fiscal
years with the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index
(the "S&P 500") and the Dow Jones Factory Equipment Industry Group, which is
described more fully below (the "Factory Equipment Group"). The graph assumes
that $100 was invested at the end of fiscal year 1996 in the Company's Common
Stock, the S&P 500 and the Factory Equipment Group. Dividend reinvestment has
been assumed and, with respect to companies in the Factory Equipment Group, the
returns of such companies have been weighted at each measurement point to
reflect relative stock market capitalization.

                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

         Arthur Andersen LLP has served as the Company's independent public
accountants and auditors since 1994, but the retention of Arthur Andersen LLP to
serve in such capacity for the current year has not yet been considered by the
Company's Board of Directors. A representative of Arthur Andersen LLP is
expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a
statement if he or she desires to do so and to be available to respond to
appropriate questions.

                  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS -- 2003 ANNUAL MEETING

         Shareholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for
shareholder action at annual meetings in accordance with regulations adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any proposal which an eligible
shareholder desires to have presented at the 2003 annual meeting of shareholders
(which is expected to be held on or about May 9, 2003) concerning a proper
subject for inclusion in the proxy statement and for consideration at the annual
meeting, will be included in the Company's proxy statement and related proxy
card if it is received by the Company no later than November 25, 2002.

             SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires that directors and certain officers of the Company, and persons who own
more than ten percent of the Company's Common Stock, file reports of ownership
of Company securities and changes in ownership of Company's securities with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that all filings
required to be made during fiscal year 2001 were made on a timely basis.

                                  OTHER MATTERS

         The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to bring any
other matters before the Annual Meeting and has no reason to believe any other
matters will be presented. If, however, other matters properly do come before
the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxy agents in the
enclosed Proxy Card to vote upon such matters in accordance with their judgment.

                                        By Order of the Board of Directors,
                                        Mary E. Vaccara
                                        Secretary
