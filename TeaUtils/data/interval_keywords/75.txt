           SECURITIES AND OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS


    Record Date and Voting Securities.  Only the record holders of
shares of the voting common stock of the Company as of the close of
business on June 1, 1996 ("Record Date"), will have the right to
receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting.  As of the

sury) issued and outstanding.  Each shareholder of record, as of
the Record Date, will have one vote for each share of voting common
stock that the shareholder owned as of the Record Date.  A majority
of all of the outstanding shares of voting common stock of the
Company entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting,
represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the
meeting.  Votes will be tabulated by inspectors of election
appointed by the Company's Board of Directors.  Abstentions and
broker non-votes are not considered as votes "For" a particular
matter.

    Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners.  The
following persons or entities who, as of the Record Date, are known
to the Company to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of the
Company's common stock.  Due to the requirements of the Securities
and Exchange Commission as to the method of determining the amount
of shares an individual or entity may beneficially own, the amounts
shown below for an individual or entity may also include shares
also considered beneficially owned by others.

    such entity.

(2) The Schedule 13D filed by Moorpark Holdings, Inc., a Delaware

    shares of Company common stock.  However, the Schedule 13D
    further notes that Moorpark is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Continental Bank, National Association ("Continental Bank").
    Continental Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of
    America of Illinois.  As a result, Continental Bank and Bank
    of America of Illinois may be considered to share the voting
    and dispositive power of the 10,367,122 shares owned of record
    by Moorpark. The address of Moorpark, Continental Bank and

    Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.  Based
solely on review of copies of the Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments
thereto furnished to the Company with respect to 1995, or written
representations that no such reports were required to be filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company believes that
during 1995 all directors and officers of the Company and
beneficial owners of more than ten percent (10%) of any class of
equity securities of the Company registered pursuant to Section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") filed
Forms 3, 4, or 5, as required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
except (I) Jay T. Edwards filed one late Form 3 to report his
election to the Company s Board of Directors, and (ii) Mark Helm
and Craig Schroeder each filed one late From 3 to report their
election as officers of the Company.  Neither Mr. Helm nor Mr.
Schroeder are currently officers of the Company.

                          EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

    The following table shows the aggregate cash compensation
which the Company and its subsidiaries paid or accrued to the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company.  No executive officers of the
Company received total compensation, including salary and bonus,
for the last completed fiscal year in excess of $100,000.  The
table includes cash distributed for services rendered during 1995,
plus any cash distributed during 1995 for services rendered in a
prior year, plus amounts deferred at the election of the named
executive officer, less any amount relating to those services
previously included in the cash compensation table for a prior
year.

    position of President of the Company upon the resignation of
    Mark Helm.  See footnote (3) below.

<PAGE>
    401-K.  The Company has adopted an Employee Savings Plan
("401-K Plan") for employees of the Company and its subsidiaries,
with certain exceptions.  The 401-K Plan provides for employee
contribution, and further provides the Company may, in the
Company's sole discretion, contribute to the 401-K Plan matching
contributions in an amount determined by the Company.  Under the
401-K Plan the Company may choose not to make matching contribu-
tions.  For an employee to be eligible to participate under the
401-K Plan, the employee must complete six months of service,
attain the age of 21 years and enter into a written salary
reduction agreement with the Company.  An employee may not
contribute more than 15% of his annual compensation into the 401-K
Plan.  If the Company, in its sole discretion, decides to make any
matching contribution in a particular year, such match will be
allocated only to employee participants who make a salary reduction
contribution to the 401-K Plan of at least 5% of their compensation
during the plan year based on a formula set forth in the 401-K
Plan.  The employee participants' contributions to the 401-K Plan
are 100% vested when made, and any match made by the Company
becomes 100% vested when allocated.  The employee participant may,
at his election, allocate his contribution and the contributions of
the Company among one or more of four (4) investment alternatives,
including the Company common stock.  The Company did not make any
matching contributions to the 401-K Plan during 1995.   

    Compensation Pursuant to Stock Option Plans.  The Company has
adopted an incentive stock option plan (the "Plan") in order to
attract, retain and motivate, and to encourage stock ownership by
key employees and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.  A
Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors administers the
Plan and selects the officers and employees to whom options may be
granted and determines the number of shares to be covered by each.
(See "Committees and Meetings of the Board of Directors.")  None of
the executive officers of the Company named in the above Summary
Compensation Table were granted options in 1995.

    The total number of shares of Company common stock for which
options may be granted under the Plan shall be 400,000 shares, less
the number of shares subject to options outstanding as of
October 3, 1989, and granted on or after June 12, 1980, and prior
to October 3, 1989, under the stock option plan then in effect.  In
the event that options granted under the Plan, or options
outstanding on October 3, 1989, under the predecessor to the Plan,
shall lapse without being exercised in whole or in part, other
options may be granted covering the shares not purchased under such
lapsed options.  The aggregate fair market value of shares as of
the date of the grant with respect to which options are exercisable
for the first time may not exceed $100,000.  The exercise price of
each option granted under the Plan may not be less than 100% of the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant
(110% in the case of options granted to employees owning more than
10% of common stock of the Company).  Each option granted under the
Plan will not be exercisable more than 5 years from the date the
option is granted.

<PAGE>
    The Plan provides that if there is a change in control (as
defined in the Plan) of the Company, all options granted under the
Plan that are outstanding as of such change in control shall
immediately become exercisable in full.

    In addition, the Company has adopted a stock option plan for
non-employee directors of the Company ("Non-Employee Director
Plan").  Under the Non-Employee Director Plan the Company may grant
options to non-employee directors of the Company to purchase up to
100,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  The maximum
aggregate number of shares of Company common stock which may be
subject to options granted under the Non-Employee Director Plan to
any one non-employee director may not exceed 20,000 shares.  Any
option granted under the Non-Employee Director Plan may not exceed
a term of five (5) years and the exercise price of such option may
not be less than the fair market value of the Company's common
stock on the date of the grant.  Under the Non-Employee Director
Plan, the Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors
supervises the administration of such plan and determines the
number of shares to be subject to each option granted under the
Non-Employee Director Plan.  No options were granted under the Non-
Employee Director Plan in 1995.

                     REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
                         ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

General

    As the Company has no formal Compensation Committee, the
functions of the Compensation Committee are performed by the entire
Board of Directors (the "Board").  The Board periodically reviews
and approves salaries, bonuses, stock options and employee benefit
plans for officers and key employees based on the criteria and
policies discussed below.


Compensation Policies

    The principle objective of the Board's compensation policy is
to establish a compensation program which aligns executive
compensation with the Company's business strategies and financial
performance.  In keeping with this objective, the Board seeks to:

     (1) Attract and retain qualified executives, in a highly
     competitive environment, who will play a significant role in
     the achievement of the Company's goals.
     
     (2) Reward executives for strategic management and the long-term
     enhancement of shareholder value.

<PAGE>     
     (3) Create a performance-oriented environment that rewards
     performance with respect to the financial and operational
     goals of the Company.
     
    There is no specific formula pursuant to which any executive
officer's compensation is adjusted or incentive awards are made.
The Board reviews an executive officer's performance in such areas
as quality and quantity of work, job and professional knowledge,
decision making and business judgment, initiative, analytical
skills, communication skills, interpersonal skills, organizational
skills, commercial skills, profit and loss sensitivity, creativity
and leadership.

    Executive compensation consists of both cash and equity-based
compensation.  Cash compensation is comprised of base salary and
bonus.  Base salary is determined with reference to industry norms.
Bonus compensation is closely tied to the Company's success in
achieving significant financial and non-financial performance goals
and an executive's success in attaining personal operational
performance goals.  Equity-based compensation is comprised of stock
option grants.  In establishing equity based compensation, the
Company places particular emphasis on the achievement of the
Company's long-term performance goals.  The Board believes that
equity based compensation closely aligns the economic interest of
the Company's officers with the economic interests of the Company's
shareholders by assuring that the Company's officers have a
meaningful stake in the Company.

Chief Executive Officer

    Carl B. Anderson, Jr. was not compensated by the Company for
his services as President and Chief Executive Officer in 1993, 1994
and 1995.  The compensation paid to Mr. Anderson in 1993, 1994 and
1995 was paid to him in his capacity as Chairman of the Board for
which he was paid $1,000 per month during 1995. Beginning July
1995, Mr. Anderson received a monthly automobile allowance of
$500.00.

    In April, 1995, the Company employed Mark Helm as President of
the Company at an annual salary of $72,000.  Until Mr. Helm's
resignation in October, 1995, he performed certain of the same
functions as a chief executive officer.  The Board set Mr. Helm's
base salary at what the Board believed was normal in the industry
the Company serves based on the revenues and profitability of the
Company.

<PAGE>
    The Board periodically reviews the President's and other
executive officers' salaries.  In determining an appropriate salary
adjustment, consideration is given to like positions within
companies of the same size and industry, the Company's earnings and
various other criteria as mentioned earlier.  The Company considers
these factors in light of the Company's overall performance as
measured by total shareholder return, adherence to the Company's
strategic plan, the development of sound management practices, and
the retention and succession of skilled personnel.

    The executive officers are eligible for annual bonus awards to
reward individual performance in meeting earnings objectives.  The
award pool for all eligible employees is based on 6% of pre-tax
earnings.  Although there is no specific formula for allocating the
award pool among eligible employees, consideration is given to
among other things, level of responsibility, length of service and
the contribution of individual employees in meeting the Company's
objectives.

    Due to the Company not meeting its earnings objectives in
1995, no bonuses were awarded to executive officers.

    In recent years the Company has granted options to certain
executive officers.  There is no specific plan to determine the
number of options granted or to the timing of granting of such
options; however certain criteria are taken into account such as
length of service, level of responsibility, and the achievement of
the Company's earnings objectives.  No options were granted to
executive officers of the Company in 1994 or 1995.

    Mr. Anderson owns 571,433 shares of the Company's common
stock.  The Board feels that Mr. Anderson has adequate incentives
through his stock ownership to increase shareholder value.

    In setting executive officers' compensation in the future, the
Board will continue to focus not only on total shareholder value,
but also on specific Company goals to advance the overall financial
success of the Company, such as earnings growth and operational
objectives which are expected to enhance shareholder value.

    The Board of Directors recommends a vote "for" the election of
the four nominees as members of the Board of Directors of the
Company.

    Committees and Meetings of the Board of Directors.  The Board
of Directors of the Company held four (4) meetings during 1995. 
All directors attended more than 75% of the meetings of the Board
of Directors and committees upon which they served during 1995.

    The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was comprised of
Messrs. Brown and Poppino.  The Audit Committee held one meeting in
1995.  The Audit Committee's functions include:  recommending a
public accounting firm for appointment by the Board of Directors
for purposes of conducting the annual audit of the Company;
reviewing the recommendations of the auditors regarding internal
controls and procedures; reviewing from time to time the Company's
general policies and procedures with respect to auditing,
accounting and the application of financial resources; reviewing
all other matters and making inquiries and investigations as are
specially referred to it by the Board of Directors; and making
recommendations to the Board as the Audit Committee may deem
appropriate.  The Company does not have a standing Nominating or
Compensation Committee.

    The Company has established a Stock Option Committee which is
currently composed of the entire membership of the Board of
Directors ("Stock Option Committee").  The Stock Option Committee
administers the Company's Incentive Stock Option Plan and Non-
Employee Director Plan.  The Committee selects the non-employee
directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom options
may be granted and determines the number of shares to be covered by
each option.

    Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation. 
The compensation of all officers of the Company is set by the Board
of Directors.  As noted, Carl B. Anderson, Jr. is both a director
and an officer of the Company. 

    Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

    In the Company's ordinary course of business, the Company
purchased 20 roll-off boxes in 1995 at an aggregate purchase price
of $120,844 from 5-Star Fabrication, Inc. ("5-Star").  In addition,
the Company utilizes the services of 5-Star in the repair of the
Company's roll-off boxes. Carl B. Anderson, Jr., President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, is the owner of
approximately 50% of 5-Star.  The Company believes that its
transactions with 5-Star are on a basis which is favorable to the
Company.

<PAGE>
    In February 1996, Carl Anderson, Jr. loaned the Company
$195,000 bearing interest at 10% per annum.  The loan is payable
upon demand and the interest is payable monthly.  The loan was for
the Company's working capital purposes and is unsecured.  As of
May 31, 1996, the outstanding balance on the loan was $186,000.

    The Company and Carl B. Anderson, Jr. have agreed that
Mr. Anderson will purchase from Environmental Transportation
Services, Inc. ("ETS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
four (4) tractors at a price of $107,000, which price was set by
the equipment lender to the Company.  Mr. Anderson will lease three
(3) of these tractors to ETS on a month-to-month basis at rental
equal to 75% of the revenues generated by each such tractor. 
Mr. Anderson has advised the Company that the fourth tractor is to
be sold by Mr. Anderson to Mr. Bill Baker, Vice President and
Secretary of the Company, and Mr. Baker has agreed to lease this
tractor to ETS on the same terms that Mr. Anderson will lease the
three tractors to ETS as described above.  The above transctions
are subject to finalization of definitive agreements, approval by
the Board of Directors of the Company and approval by the Company's
lender.  In addition, ETS is leasing from Excel Leasing Company two
(2) roll-off trailers and one (1) roll-off box for a term of 12
months, with an option to renew for an additional 12 month period,
at a rental of $3,300 per month.  Mr. Anderson is the owner of
Excel Leasing Company.  The Company believes that these
transactions are on terms favorable to the Company.

    In March, 1996, ETS, began leasing from Sullivan's Trucking,
Inc. ("Sullivan") pursuant to two operatiing leases a certain
number of hazardous waste tractors and trailers to transport waste
and a certain number of roll-off boxes.  In connection with such
leases, ETS is to pay lease payments to Sullivan of approximately
$35,000 per month for such tractors, trailers and roll-off boxes. 
The term of one lease is for a period of two (2) years and the term
of the other lease is for a period of four (4) years.  One lease
contains an option to purchase the equipment covered by such lease
at the fair market value at the time such option is exercised.

    The Company has also reached an agreement in principal to
acquire from Sullivan its customer list, good will, inventory, and
certain other assets relating to Sullivan's hazardous waste
transportation business.  The parties tentatively agreed that the
Company will pay Sullivan approximately 1.4 million shares of the
Company's common stock for the purchase of such assets, which, when
consummated, will cause Sullivan to own of record and beneficially
more than 5% of the Company's voting securities.  In addition, the
Company and Sullivan are in the process of negotiating a lease in
which ETS would lease from Sullivan its transportation terminal in
Ponca City, Oklahoma, for a term of approximately four (4) years at
a rental of $3,800 per month.  The asset purchase and the rental of
the terminal are subject to execution of definitive agreements. 
The Company and Sullivan are in the process of attempting to
finalize definitive agreements relating to these transactions.
