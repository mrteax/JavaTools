                         ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                           TO BE HELD OCTOBER 6, 1995
                     --------------------------------------


         This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the shareholders of K-Tron
International, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders of the Company to be held on October 6, 1995 and any adjournments
thereof (the "Annual Meeting").  This Proxy Statement and the enclosed Proxy
Card are being mailed to shareholders on or about August 21, 1995.

         Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card are being solicited by
and on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for the purposes set
forth in the foregoing notice of meeting.  The costs incidental to the
solicitation and obtaining of proxies, including the cost of reimbursing banks
and brokers for forwarding proxy materials to their principals, will be borne
by the Company.  Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by
officers and employees of the Company by mail, telephone, telefax, personal
interviews and other methods of communication.

         The Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December
31, 1994, including consolidated financial statements and other information
with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, is being mailed to

                             VOTING AT THE MEETING

RECORD DATE; PROXIES

         Only shareholders of record at the close of business on August 11,
1995 are entitled to notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual
Meeting and any adjournments thereof.  As of that date, the Company had
outstanding 3,103,573 shares of Common Stock.  The holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting.  Each shareholder entitled to vote
shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock outstanding in
his, her or its name.

         The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed Proxy
Card will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the
shareholder signing such Proxy Card.  The Proxy Card provides a space for a
shareholder to withhold authority to vote for the nominee for the Board of
Directors.  The nominee is to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at
the Annual Meeting.  For purposes of determining the
<PAGE>   4
number of votes cast with respect to any voting matter, only those cast "for"
or "against" are included.  If a signed Proxy Card is returned and the
shareholder has given no direction with respect to a voting matter, the shares
will be voted with respect to that matter by the proxy agents as recommended by
the Board of Directors or its Executive Committee.  Execution and return of the
enclosed Proxy Card will not affect a shareholder's right to attend the meeting
and vote in person.  Any shareholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it
by giving notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time
before the proxy is voted.

of shareholders and until such director's successor has been elected and
qualified, except in the event of such director's earlier death, resignation or
removal.  The terms of office of the Class I, Class III and Class IV directors
will expire at the annual meetings to be held in 1998, 1996 and 1997,
respectively, upon the election and qualification of their successors.

of its Nominating Committee (Mr. Wirth being the other member), has nominated
Mr. Johannes Wirth for election as the Class II director.

(unless instructed otherwise by a shareholder) to vote for the election of Mr.
Wirth as the Class II director.  In the event that the nominee should become
unable to accept nomination or election (a circumstance which the Board of
Directors does not expect), the proxy agents intend to vote for any alternate
nominee designated by the Board of Directors or its Executive Committee or, in
the discretion of the Board or its Executive Committee, the position may be
left vacant.

COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS

         The Board of Directors has an Executive Committee, an Audit and
Finance Committee, a Compensation and Human Resources Committee, a Nominating
Committee and a Stock Option Committee.  During fiscal year 1994, the Board of
Directors held seven meetings, the Executive Committee held one meeting, the
Audit and Finance Committee held five meetings, the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee held six meetings, the Nominating Committee held two
meetings and the Stock Option Committee held two meetings.  Each director
attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the meetings of the Board of
Directors held during the period for which he or she was a director during such
fiscal year and the committee or committees on which he or she served during
such period.  The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of
the Board of Directors, except action on dividends and certain other matters
which cannot by law be delegated by the Board, during the periods between
regular Board meetings.  The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for
recommending to the Board the firm to be employed by the Company as its
independent accountants and





                                      -5-
<PAGE>   8
auditors, consulting with such firm as to the annual audit and the adequacy of
internal controls, reviewing the accounting controls, practices and policies of
the Company and reviewing budgets, cash and debt management and financial
matters generally.  The Compensation and Human Resources Committee recommends
to the Board the compensation of the Company's chief executive officer, reviews
and takes action on the chief executive officer's recommendations as to the
appropriate compensation of the Company's other officers and key personnel,
approves the granting of any bonuses to officers, reviews other compensation
and personnel development matters generally and recommends to the Board the
compensation of non-management directors.  The Nominating Committee's duties
are to evaluate Board performance and recommend to the Board nominees for
election as directors, to recommend to the Board the membership of Board
committees and to recommend to the Board a successor to the chief executive
officer when a vacancy occurs.  The Stock Option Committee is responsible for
administering the Company's 1986 Stock Option Plan.  The current members of the
Executive Committee are Messrs. Beebe (Chairman), Cloues and Cohen; of the
Audit and Finance Committee, Messrs. Cloues (Chairman) and Pinola, Dr.
Schurmann and Mrs. Sisco; of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee,
Messrs.  Cohen (Acting Chairman) and Pinola and Mrs. Sisco; of the Nominating
Committee, Messrs. Cloues (Chairman) and Wirth; and of the Stock Option
Committee, Messrs. Cohen and Pinola and Mrs. Sisco.

STANDARD COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

         Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual
retainer of $12,500, a $2,000 annual retainer for each membership on any of the
Audit and Finance Committee, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee and
the Nominating Committee, a $1,000 annual retainer for membership on the
Executive Committee, $1,000 for each Board meeting attended and $750 for each
Executive Committee meeting attended provided that, in the case of Executive
Committee meetings, such meetings either require substantial preparation or
last two hours or more.  All retainers are paid on a prorated bi-monthly basis.
Directors generally do not receive compensation for their participation in
telephone meetings or for attendance at other committee meetings.  Non-employee
directors are also eligible to receive a bonus in an amount which would be a
percentage of each such director's compensation for the year in question and
would be determined by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee at the
same time that executive bonuses, if any, are determined by that Committee.  It
is contemplated that any such director bonuses would thus be related to
corporate performance on a basis similar to that used by the Compensation and
Human Resources Committee to relate senior executive bonuses to corporate
performance.  No bonuses were paid to non-employee directors for fiscal year
1994.  Furthermore, as of March 1, 1995, the Board agreed to forego all
retainer fees until otherwise determined by the Board.  Finally, under the
Company's 1988 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "1988 Plan"), each
director of the Company who is neither an employee of the Company nor the
beneficial owner of 3% or more of its outstanding Common Stock receives, upon
the later of the adoption of the 1988 Plan or his or her election as a
director, a single non-qualified stock option to purchase 10,000 shares of
Common Stock during the ten-year term of the option at an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of such stock as of the date of option grant.  The
1988 Plan was approved at the 1989 annual meeting of shareholders and replaced
the Company's prior non-employee directors stock option plan without affecting
options previously granted thereunder.

OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

         Since April 1991, Mr. Wirth, who is also a principal shareholder of
the Company, has been retained as a consultant by the Company.  Under this
arrangement, he provides technical assistance and advice on such matters as are
referred to him by the chief executive officer of the Company, and from April
1991 through February 28, 1995, he devoted approximately 1,000 hours per year
to such work.  During 1994, Mr.  Wirth received a consulting fee for these
services of Sfr. 100,000 plus Sfr. 10,000 for travel expenses (an aggregate of
$80,000 at an exchange rate of $.73 per Sfr., which was the average $/Sfr.
exchange rate for 1994).  Effective March 1, 1995, Mr. Wirth will receive a
reduced annual consulting fee of Sfr. 50,000 plus Sfr. 5,000 for travel
expenses, with a commensurate reduction in his hourly consulting commitment to
approximately 500 hours per year.

  (5)    Mr. Rohr resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer and also as
         a director of the Company on June 30, 1995.  Prior to serving as
         President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Rohr served
         as President and Chief Operating Officer until August 1992.  Mr.
         Rohr's salary was calculated in Swiss francs prior to June 1992 and in
         U.S. dollars thereafter, and the salary amount included in the table
         for 1992 is expressed in U.S. dollars using the average $/Sfr.
         exchange rate for 1992.  Bonus payments to Mr. Rohr were awarded in
         U.S. dollars.  The table does not reflect payments to the K-Tron Soder
         Pension Plan on behalf of Mr. Rohr made in accordance with applicable
         Swiss law.

  (6)    Mr. Beebe became Chief Executive Officer of the Company on June 30,
         1995 when Mr. Rohr resigned as Chief Executive Officer, a position
         which he previously held from July 1985 until August 1992.  From
         August 1992 until June 30, 1995, Mr. Beebe served as the Company's
         full-time Chairman of the Board of Directors, and he continues as its
         Chairman.  While not an executive officer under the Company's By-Laws
         from August 1992 until June 30, 1995, the Company believes that Mr.
         Beebe would have been considered an executive officer of the Company
         under the applicable regulations adopted by the Securities and
         Exchange Commission.  On February 3, 1995, Mr. Beebe assumed active
         responsibility for the Company's operations other than at its
         Colortronic GmbH subsidiary in Germany and voluntarily reduced his
         salary from $200,000 to $1 per year, effective March 1, 1995.  Mr.
         Beebe will continue to receive this $1 per year salary while serving
         as the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  While serving for this
         nominal salary, Mr. Beebe will continue to receive his health, life
         insurance and other benefits.

  (7)    Mr. Bullivant was Executive Vice President and Chief Technical Officer
         until February 1995, when he became Technical Consultant to the
         Company.  He resigned from the Company on July 7, 1995.  Mr. Bullivant
         ceased being an executive officer of the Company in February 1995.

  (8)    Mr. Schuler resigned as Senior Vice President and Controller -
         European Operations on June 23, 1995.  Mr. Schuler's salary was
         calculated and paid in Swiss francs, and the salary amount included in
         the table for 1994 is expressed in U.S. dollars using the average
         $/Sfr. exchange rate for 1994 ($.73/Sfr.).  Mr. Schuler became an
         executive officer of the Company in 1994; therefore his compensation
         for 1993 and 1992 are not required to be disclosed.

CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

         Messrs. Rohr, Bullivant, Weinberg and Schuler were employed by the
Company during fiscal year 1994 under employment agreements with the Company
effective January 1, 1992, as amended (collectively, the "Employment
Agreements").  Under these Employment Agreements, Messrs.  Rohr, Bullivant,
Weinberg and Schuler are entitled to receive a base salary, which may be
increased from time to time by the Board of Directors, and such additional
compensation and bonus payments as may be awarded to them by the Board.  These
base salaries for Messrs. Rohr, Bullivant, Weinberg and Schuler were $250,000,
$148,000, $135,000 and Sfr. 171,000 (approximately $124,800), respectively, as
of January 1, 1995.  In all cases, the Company's obligation to pay such base
salaries is subject to the Company's right to reduce them in the event
reductions are generally being made for other officers of the Company or its
subsidiaries holding comparable positions.  As of March 1, 1995, the base
salaries for Messrs. Rohr, Bullivant and Weinberg were reduced to $225,000,
$133,200 and $121,500, respectively.  In June 1995, each of Messrs. Rohr and
Schuler resigned their positions with the Company and, in July 1995, Mr.
Bullivant resigned his position with the Company.  As a result of such
resignations, the Company's obligations to each of Messrs. Rohr, Bullivant and
Schuler under their Employment Agreements terminated.  On July 17, 1995, Mr.
Weinberg's base salary was reinstated to $135,000.

         Each of the Employment Agreements provides or provided that either the
Company or the employee may terminate the employment term thereunder upon not
less than one year's prior notice (two years in the case of Mr. Rohr).  Such
employment terms are or were also subject to termination by reason of the
employee's death or disability or by the Board of Directors at any time for
"cause" as specified in such Employment Agreements.  In addition, in the case
of the Employment Agreements involving Messrs. Bullivant, Weinberg and Schuler,
the Company has or had the right to terminate the employee at any time without
cause by paying the employee a lump sum amount equal to 100% of the employee's
then-annual base salary or, if the previously described one-year notice of
termination has or had already been given by the Company to the employee, the
portion thereof relating to the balance of the employment term.

         The Employment Agreements with Messrs. Rohr and Bullivant included
provisions relating to a termination of employment upon a change in control.
For purposes of these Employment Agreements, a change of control was defined to
mean either (i) an acquisition by any person (including affiliates and
associates) of beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the Company's
outstanding Common Stock (unless the Board of Directors within 30 days after
learning thereof determines that this should not be considered a change of
control) or (ii) a change in the composition of the Board of Directors during
any two-year period such that the directors in office at the beginning of the
period no longer constitute a majority of the directors in office (unless the
election or nomination of at least two-thirds of the new directors was approved
by at least two-thirds of the directors in office at the time of such election
or nomination who were directors at the beginning of such period).  These
Employment Agreements applied to a termination of employment upon or within two
years after a change of control which, if such termination was initiated by the
Company, was for any reason other than death, disability or "cause" (as
specified in such Employment Agreements) or which, if such termination was
initiated by the employee, was upon (i) a significant reduction in such
employee's authority, duties or responsibilities, (ii) a significant breach by
the Company of its obligations under such employee's Employment Agreement,
(iii) any removal from or failure to reelect such employee to the director and
executive officer positions held by him, except in connection with promotion to
higher office, (iv) a reduction in such employee's base salary, (v) a transfer
of such employee without his consent to a location which is outside the general
metropolitan area in which his principal place of business immediately
preceding such transfer was located or which is otherwise an unreasonable
commuting distance from his principal residence or (vi) the Company's

<PAGE>   13
requirement that the employee undertake business travel to an extent that is
substantially greater than is reasonable and customary for the position he
holds.

         In the event of the termination of employment of Messrs. Rohr and
Bullivant upon a change of control, the Employment Agreements provided that,
subject to certain limitations, the Company would pay the employee (i) an
amount equal to two times such employee's base salary in effect either
immediately prior to the termination of employment or immediately prior to the
change of control, whichever was higher, and (ii) an amount equal to the spread
(the excess of market value over exercise price) on any stock options held by
such employee whether or not such options were exercisable at the date of
termination.

         Under the Employment Agreements, if the employment of Messrs. Rohr and
Bullivant had been terminated on March 1, 1995 upon or following a change of
control, the Company would have been obligated to pay them $450,000 and
$266,400, respectively.

         In May 1994, the Company and Mr. Rohr entered into an agreement
providing for the reimbursement by the Company of certain tax liabilities, if
any, incurred by Mr. Rohr upon a future Forced Sale (as hereinafter defined) of
15,839 shares of Company Common Stock acquired by him while a resident of
Switzerland (the "Swiss Shares").  The agreement arose out of Mr. Rohr's
promotion to Chief Executive Officer of the Company in 1992 and the requirement
that Mr. Rohr move from Switzerland to the United States.  As a U.S. resident,
Mr. Rohr may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local income taxes
in respect of a sale or other disposition of the Swiss Shares.  Had Mr. Rohr
remained in Switzerland, he would not have been subject to such taxes.  The
agreement provides that in the event that the Swiss Shares are sold,
transferred, exchanged or otherwise disposed of through a Forced Sale during
any taxable year in which Mr. Rohr is employed by the Company at the time of
the Forced Sale and is subject to any U.S. federal, state or local income tax
with respect to the disposition of the Swiss Shares, the Company will pay Mr.
Rohr an amount which will, on an after-tax basis, leave him in the same
financial position after payment of all taxes as if such taxes with respect to
the aggregate Offshore Gain (as hereinafter defined) had never been imposed.
The agreement defines a "Forced Sale" as any transaction with a third party not
initiated or caused by Mr. Rohr in his capacity as a shareholder of the Company
in which the Swiss Shares are sold, exchanged, transferred, converted or
otherwise disposed of in a situation where there will be a change in control of
the Company.  Examples of a Forced Sale would include a share exchange, merger,
consolidation, other transaction having a similar effect or tender offer, in
each case where there is a change in control.  "Offshore Gain" is defined as
that amount of capital gain realized by Mr. Rohr which is attributable to that
portion of the appreciation of the Swiss Shares, if any, up to an amount which
does not exceed the difference between Mr. Rohr's tax basis in such shares for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and $13.50 (which was approximately the per
share price of the Company's Common Stock when Mr. Rohr moved to the United
States).  Under this agreement, had Mr. Rohr disposed of the Swiss Shares in a
Forced Sale on March 1, 1995, the Company would have been obligated to
reimburse Mr. Rohr $5,248.  As of June 30, 1995, the Company was no longer
obligated to reimburse Mr. Rohr under this agreement.

         shown for the option grant.  These amounts are reported net of the
         option exercise price (which may be paid by delivery of already- owned

         forecast possible future appreciation, if any, of the price of the
         Company's Common Stock.  Alternative formulas for determining
         potential realizable value have not been utilized because the Company
         is not aware of any formula which will determine with reasonable
         accuracy a present value based on future unknown or volatile factors.
         There can be no assurance that the dollar amounts reflected in these
         columns will be achieved.  Actual gains, if any, on stock option
         exercises are dependent on the future performance of the Common Stock
         and overall market conditions, as well as the executive officer's
         continued employment through the vesting period.

                           REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION
                         AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE


         As members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the
"Compensation Committee"), it is our duty to review the compensation of all
executive officers of the Company, to recommend to the Board the base salary of
the Company's chief executive officer, to approve the base salaries of all
other executive officers and to approve all bonuses and other compensation
granted to executive officers.  These duties and the other responsibilities of
the Compensation Committee are more fully described on page 5 of this Proxy
Statement under the caption "Matters Concerning Directors - Committees and
Meetings."  In fulfilling these duties and responsibilities, it is the
Compensation Committee's goal to have a policy that will enable the Company to
attract, retain and reward executive officers who contribute to both its
short-term and long-term success.

         The Company's compensation policy for executives is to pay
competitively and to be fair in the administration of pay.  This is the same
policy applicable to all employees of the Company.  The Company





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   16
seeks to balance the compensation paid to a particular individual with the
compensation paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside
the Company and at other similar companies.  An informal bonus program is used
to align the total annual compensation of executives with Company performance,
individual performance and the achievement of financial and other business
objectives, and the payment of bonuses is entirely at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee.   With respect to salaries, bonuses and other
compensation, the decisions of the Compensation Committee are subjective and
are not based on any list of specific criteria.

         We believe that the compensation received by each of the executive
officers for 1994 was reasonable in view of their contributions to the Company
in 1993.  1994 was a very difficult year for the Company, particularly in
Germany, France and Asia, and no bonuses were awarded to any executive officer
for fiscal year 1994.

         The Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Marcel Rohr, had
a base salary for 1994 of $250,000, which was unchanged from 1993.  Mr. Rohr's
salary was reduced by 10% to $225,000 on March 1, 1995, which was a response to
the Company's poor performance in the fourth quarter of 1994.  Salaries of
certain other executive officers were similarly reduced.  Mr. Beebe, the
Company's full-time Chairman who replaced Mr. Rohr as Chief Executive Officer
on June 30, 1995, voluntarily reduced his annual salary from $200,000 to $1.00
on March 1, 1995.

         The Company also has a stock option plan which is administered by a
committee selected by the Board.  The members of the Compensation Committee
served as the three members of the Stock Option Committee at the time all stock
option grants were made in 1994.  The purpose of stock option grants is to
provide an additional incentive to key employees to work to maximize
shareholder value, and vesting periods are utilized to encourage such employees
to remain with the Company.  During 1994, stock options were granted by the
Stock Option Committee to Messrs. Rohr (15,000), Bullivant (1,000), Weinberg
(7,500) and Schuler (3,500).  The Company does not use restricted stock or
stock appreciation rights as a compensation vehicle, nor does it have any
long-term incentive compensation plans.  Stock option grants are entirely at
the discretion of the Stock Option Committee, including their timing, the
recipients thereof and the number of shares underlying any particular grant.

         Payments during 1994 to the Company's executives as discussed above
were made with regard to the provisions of section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which became effective on January 1, 1994.
Section 162(m) limits the deduction that may be claimed by a "public company"
for compensation paid to certain individuals to $1 million except to the extent
that any excess compensation is "performance-based compensation."  It is the
Committee's intention that no compensation will be limited as to its
deductibility under Section 162(m).

         The following line graph compares the yearly percentage change in the
cumulative total shareholder return on the Company's Common Stock for the past
five fiscal years with the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor's 500
Stock Index (the "S&P 500"), the Dow Jones Factory Equipment Industry Group,
described more fully below (the "Factory Equipment Group"), and a peer group of
companies described more fully below (the "Old Peer Group") which, until this
year, was used by the Company for purposes of the comparison.  The Company has
chosen to change the performance index from that used in the Company's 1994
Proxy Statement, the Old Peer Group, to the Factory Equipment Group because it
believes that the Factory Equipment Group represents a broader group of
comparable companies.  Three of the six companies in the Old Peer Group are
also included in the Factory Equipment Group.  Dividend reinvestment has been
assumed and, with respect to companies in each of the Factory Equipment Group
and the Old Peer Group, the returns of each such company have been weighted at
each measurement point to reflect relative stock market capitalization.  There
can be no assurance that the performance of the Company's Common Stock will
continue in a manner similar to the trend depicted on the graph.

companies which operate in the same Standard Industrial Classification industry
segment (Industrial Instruments for Measurement, Display and Control of Process
Variables and Related Products).  The Company believes that the other companies
in the Old Peer Group are comparable to the Company in terms of size and
capitalization.  The companies included in the Old Peer Group are Autoclave
Engineers, Inc., Badger Meter, Inc., K-Tron International, Inc., Moore Products
Co., MTS Systems Corp. and TSI Inc.  Prior to this year's Proxy Statement, the
Old Peer Group also included Fischer & Porter Co. which merged into a
subsidiary of Elsag Bailey Process Automation N.V. on August 10, 1994.


                 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

         Since April 1991, Johannes Wirth, a director and principal shareholder
of the Company, has been retained as a consultant by the Company.  See "Matters
Concerning Directors -- Other Compensation Arrangements."


                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

         On July 29, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed the
accounting firm of Arthur Andersen LLP as the Company's independent public
accountants and auditors.  Arthur Andersen LLP has been selected to continue in
such capacity for the current year.  A representative of that firm is expected
to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if
he or she desires to do so and to be available to respond to appropriate
questions.

         On July 29, 1994, the Company dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
Company's independent public accountants and auditors, a capacity in which that
firm had served for many years.  The decision to change the Company's
accountants and auditors was recommended by the Audit and Finance Committee of
the Board of Directors and approved by the full Board.

         At its meeting on May 12, 1994, the Board of Directors determined that
it would be appropriate to investigate whether the normal auditing and tax
services required by the Company could be obtained on a more cost effective
basis by means of a fixed fee arrangement for a three-year period. Accordingly,
the Board directed management to solicit requests for proposals from several
major accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche LLP, for audit and tax
services.  Management did so and then gave careful consideration to proposals
received from five major accounting firms. After discussions with management
and a meeting with representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP, the Audit and
Finance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Board appoint
Arthur Andersen LLP to serve as the Company's independent public accountants to
audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
for 1994.  On July 29, 1994, the Board of Directors made such appointment.

         During the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994 and the subsequent period
through July 29, 1994, the date on which Deloitte & Touche LLP was dismissed as
the Company's independent public accountants and auditors, there were no
disagreements between the Company and Deloitte & Touche LLP on any matter
relating to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure,
or auditing scope or procedures which disagreements, if not resolved to
Deloitte & Touche LLP's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference
in connection with their reports to the subject matter of the disagreement.  In
addition, Deloitte & Touche LLP's reports on the Company's financial statements
for the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994 contained no adverse opinions or
disclaimers of opinion nor were such reports qualified as to uncertainty, audit
scope or accounting principles.  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements previously filed by the Company with its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994, in the fiscal year ended
January 1, 1994, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain costs
of inventory and for income taxes.

         With respect to Item 304(a)(v)(A) of Regulation S-K, by letter dated
March 11, 1994, Deloitte & Touche LLP advised the Company of a material
weakness in its internal control structure.  In response, the Company has taken
corrective actions.

                   SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS--1996 ANNUAL MEETING

         Shareholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for
shareholder action at annual meetings in accordance with regulations adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Any proposal which an eligible
shareholder desires to have presented at the 1996 annual meeting of
shareholders (which is expected to be held on or about May 10, 1996) concerning
a proper subject for inclusion in the proxy statement and for consideration at
the annual meeting, will be included in the Company's proxy statement and
related proxy card if it is received by the Company no later than December 29,
1995.

                                 OTHER MATTERS

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires the directors and certain officers of the Company, and persons who own
more than ten percent of the Company's Common Stock, to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of
changes in ownership of such Common Stock.  Such directors, officers and more
than ten percent shareholders are required by regulation to furnish the Company
with copies of all Section 16(a) forms which they file.

         To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of
such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other
reports were required, all fiscal year 1994 Section 16(a) filing requirements
applicable to its directors, officers and more than ten percent shareholders
were complied with.  In addition, while an annual statement on Form 5 under
Section 16(a) is not required to be filed if there are no previously unreported
transactions or holdings to report, nevertheless the Company is obligated to
disclose the names of directors, covered officers and more than ten percent
shareholders who did not file an annual statement on Form 5 unless the Company
received a written statement that no such filing was required.  As of August
11, 1995, the Company had not received either an annual statement on Form 5 for
fiscal year 1994 or such a written statement from the Estate of Dr. Mario
Gallo, a more than ten percent shareholder.

         The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to bring any
other matters before the Annual Meeting and has no reason to believe any other
matters will be presented.  If, however, other matters properly do come before
the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxy agents in the
enclosed Proxy Card to vote upon such matters in accordance with their
judgment.

                                        By Order of the Board of Directors,



                                        Edward B. Cloues, II
