and sole disposition power for all 427,370 shares.

At the meeting nine directors are to be elected, each to serve until the next
Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until their successors are elected and
qualified.  If any nominee should become unavailable for any reason, it is
intended that shares represented by proxies in the accompanying form will be
voted for a substitute nominee designated by the management. The management  
has no reason to believe that any of the nominees named will not be a 
candidate or will be unable to serve if elected.

On June 9, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors adopted resolutions 
amending the Company's Stock Option Plan ("the  Plan"), in the following
respects: the Plan is to be administered by a committee consisting of not 
less than three directors, all of whom shall be "disinterested persons"; a 
committee member shall be a "disinterested person" only if such person is not, 
at the time he exercises discretion in administering the Plan, eligible, and 
has not at any time within one year prior thereto been eligible, for 
selection as a person as to whom options may be granted; and no option may be 
granted to any director as to whom the proxy statement for the meeting of 
stockholders at which the plan was submitted for approval of the stockholders 
of the Company disclosed that such director will not participate in the Plan.

On  December 7, 1995, a committee consisting of Arnold J. Frankel, Stephen
M. Goldstein and Samuel I. Hendler (Mr. Arnold J. Frankel to be chairman of 
said committee) was appointed by the Board of Directors to administer the 
Plan.  All of said directors were disinterested persons as defined by the 
Plan.

Report of the Executive Compensation Committee

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are Arnold J.
Frankel, Robert E. Parsont, Samuel I. Hendler and effective July 1, 1996, 
Leonard S. Schwartz, functions as the Executive Compensation Committee, and  
makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the remuneration of the
Company's executive officers.

The  Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the Company  
to attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and abilities  
will contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum 
profitability to the Company and its shareholders, by providing salaries and 
benefits competitive with those offered by other companies in the chemical 
industry. The  executive compensation program includes base salary, annual 
incentive compensation (cash bonuses), and long term incentive compensation 
(stock options).

Base  salaries are set at levels competitive with the chemical industry. 
Because of the way that the Company operates its business, the contributions  
of its executives significantly affect corporate profitability.  Bonuses  
(which can exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such 
contributions.  The bonuses paid to the Chairman, who is the Chief Executive 
Officer of the Company (CEO), the President, who is the Chief Operating 
Officer (COO), and the Secretary/Treasurer,  who  is the Chief Financial  
Officer (CFO), reflect the Company's overall performance (excluding 
extraordinary events such as a plant shut-down).

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, the three highest paid executive
officers, after the CEO and COO, are each responsible for the performance 
of one of the Company's principal profit centers. Internally generated  
performance records are kept on a monthly and yearly basis for these profit  
centers, and each center's profitability is compared in the current year  
to the previous year.  Other factors considered in determining the bonuses 
of individual executives are the individual's own performance and the overall 
performance of the Company.  The Executive Compensation Committee determines  
each bonus primarily based on these data, also taking into account the long  
term contributions of each individual.

The  Company's Stock Option Plan is administered by directors who do not 
receive stock options under the plan. Grants of stock options, which vary 
according to annual and longer term performance ratings, are made to senior 
and middle management executives.

Chief Executive Officer's Compensation

The CEO's compensation was determined on the basis of the same factors utilized
to compensate other executives.  Another consideration is the increase in
corporate stature and shareholder value developed over the years under his
stewardship.  The CEO, a founder of the Company, does not participate in the
Company's Stock Option Plan.

     Arnold J. Frankel, Chairman
     Samuel I. Hendler
     Robert E. Parsont
     Leonard S. Schwartz

Director Compensation

Each non-employee director receives $7,500 per year for serving on the Board  
of Directors plus $500 for each committee meeting attended. There is no 
additional compensation for directors who are also employees.

Employment Agreements

There are no employment contracts with any director or officer; however, 
Messrs. Baldi, Brunner and Schwartz have signed patent and trade secret 
agreements.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

Samuel I. Hendler, a director of the Company, serves as general counsel to the
Company.  Robert A. Wiesen, a director of the Company, is a partner in the law
firm of Clifton Budd & DeMaria, which serves as labor and employment law 
counsel of the Company.

Robert E. Parsont, a director of the Company and a nominee for election as a
director, retired from his position as President and Chief Operating Officer 
of the Company effective June 30, 1996.  The Board of Directors elected him  
Vice Chairman effective July 1, 1996, and authorized his being retained as a
consultant for a period of eighteen months. He will be paid $128,400 for
consulting services during the current fiscal year.

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's
directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of the
registered class of the Company's equity securities to file with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), initial reports of ownership 
and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity 
securities of the Company.  Officers, directors and greater than 10% 
shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies
of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  To the Company's knowledge, based solely 
on review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and 
representations that no other reports were required during the fiscal year,  
all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors 
and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with.

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP was the Company's principal accountant for the Company's
most recent fiscal year ended June 30, 1996. Representatives of KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP are expected to be present at the Stockholder's Meeting with an
opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so. Such representatives
are also expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.

The Company has not as yet selected its principal accountant for its current
fiscal year since such selection is usually made by the Company's Board of
Directors late in the fiscal year. At present, management has no reason to
believe that there will be any change in its principal accountant for the
current fiscal year.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Any proposal which a stockholder intends to present at the 1997 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders must be duly received by the Company on or before June 13, 1997.

OTHER MATTERS

The Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended June 30, 1996 
is being mailed to stockholders with this Proxy Statement.

The cost of solicitation of proxies in the accompanying form will be borne by
the Company, including expenses in connection with preparing and mailing this
Proxy  Statement. In addition to the use of mails, proxies may be solicited by
personal interview, facsimile, telephone or telegram by directors, officers  
and employees of the Company. Arrangements may also be made with brokerage  
houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of
solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by 
such persons, and the Company may reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection therewith.

The management does not know of any matters to be presented for consideration,
other than the matters described in the Notice of Annual Meeting, but if other
matters are presented, it is the intention of the persons named in the
accompanying proxy to vote on such matters in accordance with their judgment.

The Company will provide, without charge to each person whose proxy is

annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 required

financial statements and the schedules thereto. Such written request should 
be directed to Mr. Donald Horowitz, Aceto Corporation, One Hollow Lane, Lake

representation  that, as of September 20, 1996 the person making the request 
was a beneficial owner of securities entitled to vote at the annual meeting 
of stockholders.
