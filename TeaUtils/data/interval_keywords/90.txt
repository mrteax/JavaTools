                               GENERAL INFORMATION


INFORMATION ABOUT PROXY SOLICITATION

     This Proxy Statement is furnished to the holders of the common stock, $0.01
par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Aceto Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company") in connection with the solicitation of proxies on
behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for use at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders to be held on Thursday, December 4, 2003 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern
Standard Time), at the Company's offices, One Hollow Lane, Suite 201, Lake
Success, New York 11042, and at any adjournment thereof. The purposes of the
meeting and the matters to be acted upon are set forth in the accompanying
Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At present, the Board of Directors
knows of no other business which will come before the meeting.

     The Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement, and form of proxy will be
mailed to Shareholders on or about October 24, 2003. The Company will bear the
cost of its solicitation of proxies. The original solicitation of proxies by
mail may be supplemented by personal interview, telephone, telegram, and telefax
by the directors, officers and employees of the Company. Arrangements will also
be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for
the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held
by such persons, and the Company may reimburse such custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
therewith.

REVOCABILITY AND VOTING OF PROXY

     A form of proxy for use at the meeting and a return envelope for the proxy
are enclosed. Shareholders may revoke their proxies at any time before being
voted. Shares of Common Stock represented by executed and unrevoked proxies will
be voted in accordance with the instructions specified thereon. If no
instructions are given, the proxies will be voted FOR the election as directors
of management's seven nominees, FOR the proposal to amend the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation, and FOR ratification of the appointment of KPMG
LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2004.

<PAGE>

RECORD DATE AND VOTING RIGHTS

     Only stockholders of record at the close of business on October 6, 2003 are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. On
October 6, 2003, the Company had outstanding 10,344,568 shares of Common Stock,
each of which is entitled to one vote upon matters presented at the meeting.

     Votes cast at the meeting will be tabulated by persons appointed as
inspectors of election of the meeting. The inspectors of election will treat
shares of Common Stock represented by a properly signed and returned proxy as
"present" at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, without regard to
whether the proxy is marked as casting a vote or abstaining. Likewise, the
inspectors of election will treat shares of Common Stock represented by "broker
non-votes" as present for purposes of determining a quorum.

     Under New York law, (i) a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting
is necessary to elect directors, (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of all
outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock is required to amend the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation, and (iii) the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required to ratify the
appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the current
fiscal year.

     Shares represented by proxies designated as broker non-votes will be
counted for purposes of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes occur when a
broker nominee (which has voted on one or more matters at a meeting) does not
vote on one or more other matters at a meeting because it has not received
instructions to so vote from the beneficial owner and does not have
discretionary authority to so vote. Shares represented by proxies designated as
broker non-votes will not be treated as being cast for purposes of determining
the outcome of a vote on any matter, except that broker non-votes will have the
effect of a vote against the proposal to amend the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation because this proposal requires the affirmation vote of a majority
of all the Company's outstanding shares in order to be passed.

     A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be
available at the Company's office, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New York
11042, during business hours, for a period of 10 days prior to the Annual
Meeting for examination by any shareholder. Such list will also be available at
the Annual Meeting.

QUORUM

     The presence, either in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of
the shares of common stock outstanding on October 6, 2003 is necessary to
constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting.

                    ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN AT THE ANNUAL MEETING

                                  PROPOSAL ONE

                              ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
NOMINEES

     The Company's Board of Directors consists of seven Directors, each one of
which serves for a one year term and until their successors are duly elected and
qualified. The Board of Directors is proposing a slate of directors that
consists of seven incumbent directors. Our policy is for Board members to
propose nominees consistent with the interests of the Company's stakeholders.
The Board then evaluates each nominee to ensure that he or she was qualified and
met the highest standards of ethical behavior. Each director then has an
opportunity to interview each nominee if he or she deemed it necessary. The
Board then formally nominates those individuals that it unanimously agrees is in
the best interests of the Company and all its stakeholders.

     Proxies not marked to the contrary will be voted "FOR" the election of the
following seven persons:

corporate governance standards and disclosure requirements. In addition, the

(1)  All share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 stock dividend paid on January 2, 2003, as appropriate.
(2)  The dollar value of each exercisable and unexercisable option was calculated by multiplying the number of shares of common
     stock underlying the option by the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing price of the Company's
     common stock on June 30, 2003 ($18.65).

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     Directors of the Company who are not also employees receive $20,000 per year for serving on the Board of Directors plus fees
ranging from $500 to $2,000 for each committee meeting attended. Directors of the Company who are also employees are not compensated
for their services as Directors.

     On December 5, 2002, the Company granted each of Messrs. Eilender, Hendler, Wiesen, Fischer, Noetzli and Kallem 4,500
non-qualified stock options, adjusted to reflect the effect of the 3-for-2 stock dividend paid January 2, 2003, pursuant to the 2002
Stock Option Plan. Each option vests one year from the date of grant, is exercisable at $9.63 (adjusted) and expires 10 years from
the date of grant.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     On March 26, 2001, in conjunction with Aceto's acquisition of Schweizerhall Pharma, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an
employment contract with Dr. Axel Mueller. The contract has a term of three years, with an initial salary of $200,000 plus annual
increases at a rate equal to that which other senior Aceto executives receive and a minimum annual bonus of $125,000 (including
restricted stock awards). In addition, Dr. Mueller received an option for 3,750 shares (adjusted) of Aceto's common stock at 100% of
the Fair Market value at that date. Dr. Mueller is also to be provided with an automobile for his use.

     The Company has no other employment agreements with its senior executives.

LIMITS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

     The Company's Articles of Incorporation eliminate the personal liability of
its directors to the Company and its shareholders for monetary damages for
breach of the directors' fiduciary duties in certain circumstances. The Articles
of Incorporation further provide that the Company will indemnify its officers
and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Company believes that
such indemnification covers at least negligence and gross negligence on the part
of the indemnified parties. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the
Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons
of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Company
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
and is, therefore, unenforceable.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION.

     Members of the Executive Compensation Committee, with the exception of
Leonard S. Schwartz, have never served as officers or employees of the Company
or any of our subsidiaries. During the last fiscal year, none of our senior
executives served on the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of any
other entity whose officers served either on our Board of Directors or
Compensation Committee.

                 REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are
Leonard S. Schwartz (Chairman), Stanley H. Fischer, Samuel I. Hendler, Albert L.
Eilender and Robert A. Wiesen, functions as the Executive Compensation
Committee, and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the
remuneration of the Company's executive officers.

     The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the Company
to attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and abilities will
contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum profitability to
the Company and its stockholders, by providing salaries and benefits competitive
with those offered by other companies in the chemical industry. The executive
compensation program includes base salary, annual incentive compensation (cash
bonuses), and long term incentive compensation (awards under the Company's Stock
Option Plans).

     Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the chemical industry.
Because of the way the Company operates its business, the contributions of its
executives significantly affect corporate profitability. Bonuses (which can
exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such contributions. The
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) also is the Chairman of the Board, President and
Chief Operating Officer of the Company. The bonuses paid to the CEO and to the
Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), are intended to
reflect the Company's overall performance (excluding extraordinary events).

     The four highest paid executives, other than the CEO, are each responsible
for the performance of one of the Company's principal profit centers. Internally
generated performance records are kept on a monthly and yearly basis for these
profit centers, and each center's profitability is compared in the current year
to the previous year.

<PAGE>

Other factors considered in determining the bonuses of individual executives are
the individual's own performance and the overall performance of the Company. The
Executive Compensation Committee determines each bonus primarily based on this
data, also taking into account the long term contributions of each individual.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION

The CEO's compensation was determined on the basis of the same factors utilized
to compensate other executives, taking into consideration total compensation
comparisons of top executives of corporations in the chemical industry.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Audit Committee is comprised of three independent directors (each of whom
meets the independence and expertise requirements of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc.) and operates under a written charter, a copy of which
is attached hereto as Appendix A. The Audit Committee recommends the engagement
of the Company's independent auditor and reviews and considers actions of
management in matters relating to audit functions. The Audit Committee also
reviews with the independent auditor the scope and results of its audit
engagement, the Company's system of internal controls and procedures, and
reviews the effectiveness of procedures intended to prevent violations of laws.
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and
discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the Company for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 with the Company's management and KPMG LLP
("KPMG"), the Company's independent auditors.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in September 2003 the Audit
Committee established the Aceto Corporation Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy
whereby the Committee is required to pre-approve the audit fees, and the
provision of certain tax and other non-audit related services by KPMG after KPMG
provides a detailed description of the services to be performed and specific fee
estimates for each such service. The Audit Committee limits the engagement by
the Company of KPMG for non-audit services and tax services to those
circumstances where the services are considered integral to the audit services
that it provides, or in which there is another compelling rationale for using
its services. The Audit Committee considered the provision by KPMG of the below
mentioned tax services and other non-audit services and concluded that the
provision of these services was compatible with maintaining the independence of
KPMG.

The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed
by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, "Communication with Audit
Committees." In addition, the Audit Committee has received the

<PAGE>

written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by Independence Standards
Board Standard No. 1, "Independence Discussions with Audit Committees" and has
discussed with KPMG its independence from the Company and its management.

Finally, in reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated
financial statements for the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 be
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2003
which has been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE SEVEN
DIRECTORS.

                                  PROPOSAL TWO

                           AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANY'S
                          CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     We propose to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to increase
the number of authorized shares of the Company's Common Stock from 20,000,000 to
40,000,000.

     The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company currently authorizes
20,000,000 shares of Common Stock. As of October 6, 2003, the Company had issued
12,292,684 shares of common stock, with 10,344,568 shares outstanding, and
1,948,116 shares held as treasury stock. In addition, as of that date, the
Corporation has reserved up to 1,947,041 shares of its Common Stock for issuance
upon the exercise of options and premium shares on restricted stock. After
giving effect to both the common shares issued and the common shares reserved
for issuance, there were 5,760,275 authorized but unissued shares available to
the Company as of October 6, 2003.

     On October 1, 2003, the Board of Directors approved and adopted resolutions
to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of
authorized shares of Common Stock to 40,000,000. The additional shares, if
issued, would have the same rights as the shares of Common Stock now
outstanding.

     The Board of Directors believes that the proposed increase is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board believes that the
additional shares will be necessary for the Company's legitimate corporate
purposes, including equity financings, the acquisition of other companies, the
establishment of strategic relationships with corporate partners, the
declaration of stock dividends, stock splits or other distributions, and other
general corporate purposes.

     You should be aware, however, that if the Company's shareholders approve
the proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of
Directors may authorize the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock
without further approval of the Company's shareholders, except as may be
required in certain cases by the Company's charter documents or applicable law
or regulations. Under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's
shareholders do not have preemptive rights to subscribe to additional securities
which may be issued by the Company, which means that current shareholders do not
have a prior right to purchase any new issue of capital stock of the Company in
order to maintain their proportionate ownership of the Common Stock.
Furthermore, if the Board elects to issue additional shares of Common Stock or
securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock, such
issuance could have a dilutive effect on the voting power and earnings per share
of existing shareholders.

<PAGE>

     In addition, the increase in the number of authorized shares of Common
Stock could have an anti-takeover effect. For example, if the Board issues
additional shares in the future, such issuance could dilute the voting power of
a person seeking control of the Company, thereby rendering more difficult a
merger, tender offer, proxy contest or an extraordinary transaction opposed by
the Board of Directors. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board is not
aware of any attempt or plan to obtain control of the Company.

     If approved, the amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation
would provide substantially as is set forth in Appendix E hereto.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S AUTHORIZED SHARES OF
COMMON STOCK.

               RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Company has engaged KPMG LLP as its principal independent public
accountants to perform the audit of the Company's financial statements for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. KPMG LLP has audited the Company's financial
statements since 1971. The Audit Committee recommends that KPMG LLP be ratified
as the principal accounting firm to be utilized by the Company throughout the
year ending June 30, 2004.

     The Company anticipates that representatives of KPMG LLP will attend the
Annual Meeting for the purpose of responding to appropriate questions. At the
Annual Meeting, the representatives of KPMG LLP will be afforded an opportunity
to make a statement if they so desire.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF KPMG
LLP AS THE COMPANY'S AUDITORS FOR THE 2004 FISCAL YEAR.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

     All shareholder proposals which are intended to be presented at the 2004
Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company must be received by the Company no
later than June 18, 2004, for inclusion in the Board of Directors' proxy
statement and form of proxy relating to the meeting.

OTHER BUSINESS

     The Board of Directors knows of no other business to be acted upon at the
meeting. However, if any other business properly comes before the meeting, it is
the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote on such matters
in accordance with their best judgment.

     The prompt return of the proxy will be appreciated and helpful in obtaining
the necessary vote. Therefore, whether or not you expect to attend the meeting,
please sign the proxy and return it in the enclosed envelope.

                                ACETO CORPORATION
                             AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER

PURPOSE OF THE COMMITTEE

     The primary purpose of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is to assist
the Board of Directors of Aceto Corporation (the "Company") in fulfilling its
oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information which will be
provided to the Company's shareholders and others, the quality of the Company's
accounting policies and reporting practices, the systems of internal disclosure
controls which management and the Board of Directors have established,
compliance with the Company's Code of Ethics, and the internal and external
audit processes. The Committee is to assist the Board in maintaining compliance
by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements.

     In fulfilling its purpose, it is the responsibility of the Committee to
provide an open avenue of communication between the Board of Directors,
management and the independent auditors. The Committee is to be the Board's
principal agent in ensuring the independence and objectivity of the independent
auditors, the integrity of management, and the adequacy of disclosure to
shareholders. The independent auditors are ultimately accountable to the Board
of Directors and the Committee, as representative of the Company's shareholders;
however, the Committee has the sole authority to select, evaluate, and, where
appropriate, replace the independent auditors.

     The Committee members are not acting as professional accountants or
auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or substitute for
the activities of management and the independent auditors. The Committee serves
a Board-level oversight role in which it provides advice, counsel and direction
to management and the independent auditors on the basis of information it
receives, discussion with the accountants and the experience of the Committee's
members in business, financial and accounting matters.

AUTHORITY OF THE COMMITTEE

     The Committee has the authority to investigate any activity of the Company
within its scope of responsibilities, and shall have unrestricted access to
members of management and all information relevant to its responsibilities. All
employees are directed to cooperate as requested by members of the Committee.
The Committee is empowered to retain persons having special competence as
necessary to assist the Committee in fulfilling its responsibility.

COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEE

     The Committee shall be comprised of at least three members, all of whom
shall meet the independence requirements and experience qualifications of the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and The Nasdaq
Stock Market, Inc ("Nasdaq"). At

<PAGE>

least one member of the Audit Committee shall be an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined by the SEC. The Audit Committee members shall be appointed by
the Company's Board of Directors. Audit Committee members may be replaced by the
Board.

MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE

     The Audit Committee shall meet, either in person or telephonically, at
least quarterly. Prior to each meeting, the Chairman of the Committee may
communicate with the independent auditors to review the agenda and solicit input
on any additional topics that should be covered. The Audit Committee shall also
meet periodically, in the discretion of the Chairman of the Committee, with
Company's management, and the independent auditor in separate executive
sessions.

ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE

     Members of the Committee are expected to use all reasonable efforts to
attend each meeting. The Chairman may also request that members of management,
the Company's outside counsel or the independent auditor attend a meeting of the
Committee or meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Committee.

MINUTES OF MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE

     Minutes of each meeting shall be prepared under the direction of the
Chairman of the Committee and circulated to Committee members for review and
approval. Copies are then to be made available to the Company directors who are
not members of the Committee, the independent auditors and the Company's Chief
Financial Officer.

SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE

General Matters

     The Committee shall:

     1.   Oversee the work and compensation of the independent auditor in
          connection with the preparation by the independent auditor of its
          audit report.

     2.   Review the scope of the independent auditor's audit examination,
          including their engagement letter, prior to the annual audit. Review
          and approve the audit fees agreed upon by management. Approve any
          permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent
          auditors. The Chairman has the authority to approve any additional
          audit or permitted non-audit services provided to the Company,
          provided that the approval of such services is ratified by the entire
          Committee as soon as reasonably practicable by either an electronic
          communication with all the committee members, a telephonic meeting
          with all the committee members, or another prompt method, but in all
          instances, such ratification shall be considered and passed upon by
          the Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

<PAGE>

     3.   Have the authority to recommend to the Board the retention or
          replacement of the independent auditors, and provide a written summary
          of the basis for any recommended change (subject, if applicable, to
          shareholder ratification). The independent auditor shall report
          directly to the Audit Committee.

     4.   Have the authority, to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate,
          to retain independent legal, accounting or other advisors. The Company
          shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit
          Committee, for payment of compensation to the independent auditor for
          the purpose of rendering or issuing an audit report and to any
          advisors employed by the Audit Committee.

Financial Statement and Disclosure Matters

     The Committee shall:

     1.   Review and discuss with management and the independent auditor the
          annual audited financial statements, including disclosures made in
          management's discussion and analysis, and recommend to the Board

          of the quarterly financial statements.

     3.   Discuss with the independent auditor the matters required to be
          discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 relating to the
          conduct of the audit, including any difficulties encountered in the
          course of the audit work, any restrictions on the scope of activities
          or access to requested information, and any significant disagreements
          with management.

     4.   Discuss with management and the independent auditor significant
          financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the
          preparation of the Company's financial statements, including any
          significant changes in the Company's selection or application of
          accounting principles, any major issues as to the adequacy of the
          Company's internal controls and any special steps adopted in light of
          material control deficiencies, if any.

     5.   Review and discuss quarterly reports from the independent auditors on:
          (a) all critical accounting policies and practices to be used; (b) all
          alternative treatments of financial information within generally
          accepted accounting principles that have been discussed with
          management, ramifications of the use of such alternative disclosures
          and treatments, and the treatment preferred by the independent
          auditor; and (c) other material written communications between the
          independent auditor and management, such as any management letter or
          schedule of unadjusted differences.

          including the use of "pro forma" or adjusted" non-GAAP information, as
          well as financial information and earnings guidance provided to
          analysts and rating agencies.

     7.   Discuss with management and the independent auditor the effect of
          regulatory and accounting initiatives as well as off-balance sheet
          structures on the Company's financial statements, if any.

     8.   Discuss with management the Company's major risk exposures and the

          and CFO during their certification process for the Form 10-K and Form
          10-Q about any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
          internal controls or material weaknesses therein and any fraud
          involving management or other employees who have a significant role in
          the Company's internal controls.

Oversight of the Company's Relationship with the Independent Auditor

     The Committee shall:

     1.   Review and evaluate the lead partner of the independent auditor team.

     2.   Obtain and review a report from the independent auditor at least
          annually regarding (a) the independent auditor's internal
          quality-control procedures, (b) any material issues raised by the most
          recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the firm,
          or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional
          authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more
          independent audits carried out by the firm, (c) any steps taken to
          deal with any such issues, and (d) all relationships between the
          independent auditor and the Company. Evaluate the qualifications,
          performance and independence of the independent auditor, including
          considering whether the auditor's quality controls are adequate and
          the provisions of the permitted non-audit services is compatible with
          maintaining the auditor's independence, taking into account the
          opinions of management and internal auditors. The Audit Committee
          shall present its conclusions with respect to the independent auditor
          to the Board.

     3.   Oversee the rotation of the audit partners as required by law.

     4.   Meet with the independent auditor to discuss the planning and staffing
          of the audit.

<PAGE>

Compliance Oversight Responsibilities

     The Committee shall:

     1.   Obtain from the independent auditor assurance that to its knowledge
          Section 10A(b) of the Exchange Act has not been implicated.

     2.   Review management's monitoring of the Company's compliance with its
          Code of Ethics. Review reports and disclosures of insider and
          affiliate party transactions.

     3.   Establish procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of
          complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal
          accounting controls or auditing matters, and the confidential,
          anonymous submission by the employees of concerns regarding the
          questionable accounting or auditing matters.

     4.   Discuss with management and the independent auditor any correspondence
          with regulators or governmental agencies and any published reports
          which raise material issues regarding the Company's financial
          statements or accounting policies.

     5.   Discuss with the Company's outside counsel legal matters that may have
          a material impact on the financial statements or the Company's
          compliance policies.

Limitation of Audit Committee's Role

     While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in
this Charter, it is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct
audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements and disclosures
are complete and accurate and are in accordance with the generally accepted
accounting principles and applicable rules and regulations. These are either the
responsibilities of management or the independent auditor, as applicable.

<PAGE>

                                                                      APPENDIX B

                            CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT

     Aceto expects all representatives of the company and its subsidiaries to
act in accordance with the highest standards of personal and professional
integrity in all aspects of their activities and to comply with all applicable
laws, regulations and company policies. We must never compromise that integrity,
either for personal benefit or for Aceto's purported benefit. In accepting a
position, or continuing in a position, with Aceto or any of its subsidiaries,
each of us becomes accountable for compliance with the law and with this Code of
Business Conduct.

     This Code of Business Conduct applies to all representatives of Aceto and
its subsidiaries, including directors, employees, temporary workers and other
independent contractors and consultants. It is your responsibility to become
familiar with the policies set forth herein.

     If you have any questions about these policies, you should discuss them
with Aceto's Corporate Secretary or Human Resources Manager. As a general
matter, when there is a conflict between internal policies that apply to you or
between jurisdictions in which you conduct business, the more restrictive policy
will prevail. Waivers of this Code of Business Conduct, if any, may only be
granted by Aceto's Board of Directors and must be publicly disclosed promptly.

     Aceto expects you to act in full compliance with the policies set forth in
this Code of Business Conduct and in a manner consistent with the highest
ethical standards. Failure to observe these policies may result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination of employment. Furthermore, violations
of this Code of Business Conduct may also be violations of the law and may
result in civil or criminal penalties for you and/or Aceto.

     This Code of Business Conduct sets forth guidelines only and does not
constitute or imply an employment contract, nor is it intended to make a
commitment to any employee concerning how individual employment action can,
should, or will be handled.

Responsibilities to Aceto

RAISING ETHICAL ISSUES

     Maintaining ethical standards, including appropriate disclosure and
internal accounting controls, is the responsibility of every member of the Aceto
family. Early identification and resolution of the ethical issues that may arise
are critical to maintaining our commitment to world-class business practices.

     Aceto personnel are expected to treat compliance with ethical standards as
a critical element of their responsibilities. Although this Code of Business
Conduct addresses a wide

<PAGE>

range of business practices and procedures, it cannot anticipate every issue
that may arise. If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, you should
seek additional guidance and information before you act. You should use your
judgment and common sense; if something seems unethical or improper it probably
is. If you have any questions regarding the best course of action in a
particular situation, or if you suspect a possible violation of a law,
regulation or Aceto ethical standard, you should promptly contact any of the
following:

Your supervisor
Your Human Resources representative
Aceto's Compliance Officer and independent board member Robert A. Wiesen, Esq.
at (212) 687-7410, or at rawiesen@cbdm.com

     You should feel free to contact either someone in your business unit or
someone at the corporate level, whichever you believe is more appropriate.
Alternatively, you may choose to remain anonymous by sending an anonymous e-mail
to the secure location on Aceto's corporate web site. If you raise an ethical
issue and you believe the issue has not been properly addressed, you should
raise it with another of the contacts listed above.

     In addition, you are required to report suspected insider trading, fraud or
attempted fraud, and any mysterious disappearance of funds immediately. You may
do so by contacting any of the persons listed above or sending an anonymous
e-mail to the secure location on Aceto's corporate web site.

     Aceto strongly encourages personnel to raise possible ethical issues. Aceto
has adopted a Non-Retaliation Policy which specifically prohibits any
retaliatory action against any individual for raising legitimate concerns or
questions regarding ethics matters or for reporting suspected violations.

PROTECTING ACETO'S CORPORATE ASSETS

     You are responsible for safeguarding the tangible and intangible assets of
Aceto and its customers, suppliers and distributors that are under your control.
Aceto assets must not be used for personal benefit except where permitted by
Aceto in line with local practices and laws. Assets include cash, business
plans, customer information, supplier information, distributor information,
intellectual property (computer programs, models and other items), physical
property and services.

     Misappropriation of corporate assets is a breach of your duty to Aceto and
may constitute an act of fraud against Aceto. Similarly, carelessness or waste
in regard to corporate assets is also a breach of your duty to Aceto.

     Aceto has strict policies regarding the use of its telephone, e-mail and
voice-mail systems. Each is a business communication tool and users are
obligated to use these tools in a responsible, effective and lawful manner.
Violations of Aceto's policies regarding these tools can result in corrective
action up to and including discharge.

<PAGE>

ACCURACY OF ACETO'S RECORDS AND REPORTING

     The records, data and information owned, used and managed by Aceto must be
accurate and complete. You are personally responsible for the integrity of the
information, reports and records under your control. Records must be maintained
in sufficient detail as to reflect accurately the company's transactions.
Financial statements must always be prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial condition and results of the company.

     You must use common sense and observe standards of good taste regarding
content and language when creating business records and other documents (such as
e-mail) that may be retained by Aceto or a third party. You should keep in mind
that at a future date, Aceto or a third party may be in a position to rely on or
interpret the document with the benefit of hindsight and/or the disadvantage of
imperfect recollections.

     You are required to cooperate fully with appropriately authorized internal
and external investigations. Making false statements to or otherwise misleading
internal or external auditors, Aceto counsel, Aceto representatives or
regulators can be a criminal act that can result in severe penalties. You must
never withhold or fail to communicate information that raises ethical questions
and thus should be brought to the attention of higher levels of management.

     You are prohibited from destroying any records that are potentially
relevant to a violation of law or any litigation or any pending, threatened or
foreseeable government investigation or proceeding.

     Aceto is also committed to accuracy in tax-related records, and to tax
reporting in compliance with the overall intent and letter of applicable laws.
Tax returns must be filed on a timely basis and taxes due paid on time.

Representing Aceto to Customers and Others

FAIR TREATMENT

     Aceto is committed to dealing fairly with its customers, suppliers,
competitors and employees. No person may take unfair advantage of any such
persons through manipulation, concealment, abuse of confidential information,
misrepresentation of material facts or other unfair dealing practice.

MEDIA, PUBLISHING AND PUBLIC APPEARANCES

     Aceto employees may be approached for interviews or comments by the news
media from time to time and in such instances should immediately contact Aceto's
Chief Executive Officer. Only contact people designated by the Chief Executive
Officer may comment to news reporters on Aceto policy or events relevant to
Aceto.

<PAGE>

     All inquiries from the media relating to Aceto should be referred to
Aceto's Chief Executive Officer. Only officially designated spokespersons may
provide comments for the media.

Gifts and Entertainment

ACCEPTING GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

     In general, you should not accept gifts or the conveyance of anything of
value (including entertainment) from current or prospective Aceto customers or
suppliers. Moreover, you should never accept a gift in circumstances in which it
could even appear to others that your business judgment has been compromised.

     Gifts may only be accepted from current or prospective Aceto customers or
suppliers when permitted under applicable law if they are: (1) noncash gifts of
nominal value; or (2) customary and reasonable meals and entertainment at which
the giver is present, such as the occasional business meal or sporting event.
Any gift which appears to be of more than a nominal value must be reported to
the Human Resources Manager of Aceto, and may be returned to the source.

GIVING GIFTS AND PROVIDING ENTERTAINMENT

     If a gift could be seen by others as a consideration for an official or
business favor, you must not give the gift. Appropriate entertainment may be
offered to customers by persons authorized to do so, subject to the applicable
business expense reimbursement requirements.

     The United States and other countries, states and many local jurisdictions
have laws restricting gifts (e.g., meals, entertainment, transportation, lodging
or other things of value) that may be provided to government officials. In
addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") outlines very
serious provisions against bribery, including the payment, or promise of
payment, of anything of value to foreign officials (including any person
employed by or representing a foreign government, officials of a foreign
political party, officials of public international organizations and candidates
for foreign office). Payment made indirectly through a consultant, contractor or
other intermediary is also prohibited.

POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS

     You have the right voluntarily to participate in the political process. No
one at Aceto may require you to contribute to, support or oppose any political
group or candidate. If you choose to participate in the political process, you
must do so as an individual, not as a representative of Aceto. You may not work
on a political fundraiser or other campaign activity while at work or use
company property for these activities. Any overt, visible and partisan political
activity that could cause someone to believe that your actions reflect the views
or position of Aceto requires the prior approval of Aceto's Chief Executive
Officer.

<PAGE>

LOBBYING

     Aceto encourages every employee to take an active interest in government
processes. Any participation in a political process, however, is to be
undertaken as an individual - not as a representative of Aceto. You must not
engage in lobbying activities on behalf of Aceto.

Investments and Activities Outside of Aceto

INSIDER TRADING

     Aceto has adopted a Corporate Trading Policy. This policy and the laws of
the United States and many other countries prohibit trading in the securities
(including equity securities, convertible securities, options, bonds and any
stock index containing the security) of any company while in possession of
material, nonpublic information (also know as "inside information") regarding
the company. This prohibition applies to transactions for your personal account.
A personal account is any account in which you have a financial or beneficial
interest, or the power to affect or the ability to influence trading or
investment decisions, either directly or indirectly. Personal accounts typically
include accounts of spouses, domestic partners, children and other members of
your household, and accounts over which you have investment discretion.

     If you believe you have come into possession of inside information, you may
not execute any trade in the securities of the subject company without first
consulting with Aceto's Corporate Secretary, who will then determine whether
such trade would violate Aceto's Corporate Trading Policy or applicable laws.
The definition of "material, nonpublic information" is broad. Information is
"material" (and hence, potentially subject to the prohibition on insider
trading) if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would
consider the information important in determining whether to trade in a
security, or if the information, if made public, likely would affect the market
price of a company's securities. Information may be material even if it relates
to future, speculative or contingent events, and even if it is significant only
when considered in combination with publicly available information. Information
is considered to be "nonpublic" unless it has been publicly disclosed, and
adequate time has passed for the securities markets to digest the information.
Examples of adequate disclosure include public filings with securities
regulatory authorities and the issuance of press releases.

     It is also illegal in the United States and many other countries to "tip"
or pass on inside information to any other person if you know or reasonably
suspect that the person receiving such information from you will misuse
information by trading in securities or passing such information on further,
even if you do not receive any monetary benefit from the tippee.

PERSONAL INVESTMENTS IN ACETO SECURITIES

     Aceto supports employee stock ownership. Investments in Aceto securities
for personal accounts should be made with a long-term orientation and as part of
a broader

<PAGE>

investment strategy. In order to comply with applicable law and avoid the
appearance of impropriety, certain general restrictions apply to all
transactions in Aceto securities.

     You are prohibited from trading in Aceto securities for your personal
accounts if you possess material nonpublic information about Aceto.

     Additionally, directors and officers are subject to reporting and other
legal restrictions regarding their personal trading of Aceto securities. You are
responsible for knowing and abiding by any Aceto policies regarding Aceto
securities that may be applicable to you.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     You must be sensitive to any activities, interests or relationships that
might interfere with, or even appear to interfere with, your ability to act in
the best interests of Aceto and its customers. The following are only some of
the areas in which real or perceived conflicts of interest may arise. Because it
is impossible to describe every potential conflict, Aceto necessarily relies on
your commitment to exercise sound judgment, to seek advice when appropriate and
to adhere to the highest and ethical standards in the conduct of your
professional and personal affairs.

INVESTMENTS

     You must not make any personal investment in an enterprise if your position
at Aceto creates a conflict of interest or the appearance of such a conflict.
Investments subject to this provision include investments in a public or private
company that is a vendor to or competitor of Aceto, or otherwise does business
with or is doing a transaction with Aceto. This provision will not apply to
personal investments in enterprises having a business relationship with Aceto
that is solely that of a customer of Aceto products available to similarly
situated customers on substantially the same basis, or to investments of under
1% of the outstanding equity securities of a public company.

OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

         Because of potential conflicts with Aceto or even the potential
perception of a conflict of interest, Aceto requires that employees obtain
approval before they accept a position as a director of an unaffiliated
for-profit company or organization. Any employee accepting an appointment as
director of an unaffiliated for-profit company or organization must ensure the
proper treatment of confidential information received from such entity in
connection with being a director. Before accepting such an appointment,
employees are required to obtain the written approval of Aceto's Corporate
Secretary. In addition, employees should not accept or hold a position as a
director, officer, employee or agent of, or consultant or advisor to, any
competitor of, or vendor to, Aceto or any of its affiliates unless they obtain
the written approval of the Corporate Secretary.

<PAGE>

USE OF ACETO NAME, FACILITIES OR RELATIONSHIPS

     You should not use Aceto's name, facilities, or relationships for personal
benefit or for outside work. Use of Aceto's name, facilities or relationships
for charitable or pro bono purposes can be made only with prior approval from
the Corporate Secretary.

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

     You owe a duty to Aceto to advance its legitimate interests when the
opportunity to do so arises. You may not take for yourself a corporate
opportunity that is discovered in the course of your employment or through the
use of corporate property, information or your position, nor may you compete
against the company.

RELATED PARTY BUSINESS DEALINGS

     You must notify your supervisor of any business relationship or proposed
business relationship or proposed business transaction Aceto may have with any
company in which you or a related party has a direct or indirect interest or
from which you or a related party may derive a benefit, or where a related party
member is employed, if such a relationship or transaction might give rise to the
appearance of a conflict of interest (for example, if you or a family member own
or control property of significant value that Aceto is either purchasing or
leasing).

     This requirement generally excludes any interest that exists solely as a
result of your ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding publicly traded
equity securities of such company.

COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT

     Aceto is committed to conducting business in an environmentally responsible
manner that protects human health, natural resources and the global environment.
The U.S. and many other countries have laws and regulations relating to
environmental protections. Environmental risks or opportunities that may arise
out of our operations should be identified and managed in accordance with these
laws and regulations. Questions regarding environmental concerns should be
directed to Aceto's environmental affairs department or to the Corporate
Secretary.

Conclusion

     We at Aceto aspire to the highest standards of moral and ethical conduct -
- - working to earn the trust of our customers, day in and day out. In the
thousands of decisions we make and actions we take every day, we affirm our
commitment to this Code of Business Conduct and to deliver value to our
customers, our people, our shareholders and our communities.

                          DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE CHARTER

     This disclosure committee (the "Committee") charter (the "Charter") has
been established by Aceto Corporation (the "Company") and ratified by the
Company's board of directors to assist the Company's chief executive officer and
chief financial officer (the "Certifying Officers").

     I.   OBJECTIVE

     The Committee has been formed to help ensure that disclosures made by the
Company in its United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
