<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March&nbsp;19, 2004 are
entitled to notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As
of that date, the Company had outstanding 2,466,354 shares of Common Stock.
The holders of a majority of such shares, represented in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is necessary before
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting except that, even if a quorum
is not present, the shareholders present in person or by proxy shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Each
shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to one vote for each share of
Common Stock outstanding in such shareholder&#146;s name.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed Proxy
Card will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the
shareholder signing such Proxy Card. The Proxy Card provides spaces for a
shareholder to vote for the Board&#146;s nominees, or to withhold authority to vote
for either or both of such nominees, for election as directors. Directors are
to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. With
respect to any other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual
Meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders
entitled to vote thereon is required to take action, unless a greater
percentage is required either by law or by the Company&#146;s Restated Certificate
of Incorporation or By-laws. In determining the number of votes cast with
respect to any voting matter, only those cast &#147;for&#148; or &#147;against&#148; are included.
Abstentions will be considered present and entitled to vote at the Annual
Meeting but will not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly, abstentions will
have no effect on the vote. Similarly, where brokers submit proxies but

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Committees and Meetings</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and a
Compensation and Human Resources Committee. The members of the Compensation
and Human Resources Committee also constitute the members of the two committees
that administer the Company&#146;s equity compensation plans (collectively, the
&#147;Stock Option Committee&#148;). During fiscal year 2003, the Board held six
meetings (including one by telephone conference), the Audit Committee held ten
meetings (including four by telephone conference), the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee held four meetings (including one by telephone conference),
the Stock Option Committee did not meet separately from the Compensation and
Human Resources Committee and the Executive Committee met once by telephone
conference. Each director except for Mr.&nbsp;Engel attended at least 75% of the
aggregate of the fiscal year 2003 meetings of the Board and of the Board
committee or committees on which he served during the year. This was the only
year since he became a director in 1999 that Mr.&nbsp;Engel did not meet this test;
he missed several meetings during a short time period when he and his family
were relocating from London, England to the United States. The Company had a
Nominating Committee until the death of one its members in 2001; since that
time, the full Board has assumed responsibility for the duties normally
associated with a nominating committee. After the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
(&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) adopted new rules and regulations in late 2003 relating to corporate
governance and listing requirements, the Board reconsidered its decision not to
have a formal Nominating Committee and determined that this decision was
appropriate based on a number of factors, including the size of the

Board, the number of independent directors and the existing commitments of
those independent directors to Board committees. In addition, the Board
determined that recommendations regarding future director nominations,
including nominations as a result of vacancies, would be made by a majority of
the Company&#146;s independent directors and that the final selection would be made
by the entire Board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of the Board,
except action on dividends and certain other matters that cannot by law be
delegated by the Board, during the periods between regular Board meetings. The
primary purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board in its
oversight of the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company,
the audits of the financial statements of the Company and the Company&#146;s
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; to interact directly with
and evaluate the performance of the independent auditors, including to
determine whether to engage or dismiss the independent auditors and to monitor
the independent auditors&#146; qualifications and independence; and to prepare the
report required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to be included in the Company&#146;s annual proxy statement. As for the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee, its main purposes are to establish
and periodically review the Company&#146;s compensation philosophy and the adequacy
of compensation plans and programs for executive officers and other employees;
to establish compensation arrangements for executive officers and to administer
compensation plans; to review the performance of the executive officers and
award incentive compensation and adjust compensation arrangements as
appropriate based upon performance; to review and monitor management
development and succession plans and activities; and to prepare the report on
executive compensation for inclusion in the Company&#146;s annual proxy statement in
accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. The
Stock Option Committee is responsible for administering the Company&#146;s 1996
Equity Compensation Plan and another stock option plan that has expired (but
under which there remain outstanding stock options).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current members of the Executive Committee are Messrs.&nbsp;Cloues
(Chairman) and Cohen; of the Audit Committee, Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola (Chairman), Engel
and Hurd; of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, Messrs.&nbsp;Cohen
(Chairman) and Pinola; and of the Stock Option Committee, Messrs.&nbsp;Cohen and

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Affirmative Determination Regarding Director Independence and Other Corporate
Governance Matters</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company operates within a comprehensive plan of corporate governance
for the purpose of defining director independence, assigning Board
responsibilities, setting high standards of professional and personal conduct
for directors, officers and employees and assuring compliance with such
responsibilities and standards. The Company regularly monitors developments in
the area of corporate governance. In July&nbsp;2002, Congress passed the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which, among other things, established or provided
the basis for a number of new corporate governance standards and disclosure
requirements. In addition, Nasdaq has recently adopted changes to its
corporate governance and listing requirements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has determined that the following directors, constituting four
of the Company&#146;s five directors and thus a majority of the Board, are each an
&#147;independent director&#148; as such term is defined in Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4200(a)(15)
of the National Association of Securities Dealers (the &#147;NASD&#148;): Norman Cohen,
Robert A. Engel, Edward T. Hurd and Richard J. Pinola. The Board also has
determined that each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee and the Stock Option Committee meets the independence
requirements applicable to those committees as prescribed by the NASD, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and applicable
committee charters. The Board has further determined that Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola and
Engel, who are two of the three members of the Audit Committee, are each an
&#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; as such term is defined in Item 401(h) of
Regulation&nbsp;S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Statement of Corporate Ethics and Code of Business Conduct</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has adopted a Statement of Corporate Ethics and Code of Business
Conduct applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company.
Violations of the Statement of Corporate Ethics and Code of Business Conduct
may be reported to the Company&#146;s Corporate Ethics Officer or, in cases
involving accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, to the
Chairperson of the Audit Committee or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer. A

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Standard Compensation Arrangements</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual retainer
of $15,000, a $2,000 annual retainer for each membership on the Audit Committee
and the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, a $1,000 annual retainer
for membership on the Executive Committee, $1,000 for each Board meeting
attended and $750 for each Executive Committee meeting attended provided that,
in the case of an Executive Committee meeting, such meeting either requires
substantial preparation or lasts for two hours or more. In addition, the
Chairperson of the Audit Committee and the Chairperson of the Compensation and
Human Resources Committee are each paid an additional $1,500 for their service
in such capacities. All retainers are paid on a prorated bi-monthly basis.
Directors generally do not receive compensation for their participation in
telephone meetings or for attendance at other committee meetings. Under the
1996 Equity Compensation Plan, non-employee directors are eligible to receive
stock options and, unless the Stock Option Committee determines otherwise
(which has not been the case in the past), on the date of each annual meeting
of shareholders of the Company, each non-employee director receives a stock
option grant to purchase 1,000 shares of Common Stock with an option price per
share equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on that date.
Such options are fully vested on the date of grant and have a ten-year term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Share Ownership Guideline</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each non-employee director is required to own shares of Common Stock with
a value, at the greater of cost or market, equal to $50,000. As for any
newly-elected director, this requirement may be phased in over a period of time
to be determined by the Board. All directors are in compliance with this
guideline with the exception of the most recently-elected director, Mr.&nbsp;Hurd,
who as of March&nbsp;19, 2004 owned 1,500 shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Directors&#146; Attendance at Annual Meeting of Shareholders</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been and is the policy of the Board that all directors attend the
annual meeting of shareholders except where the failure to attend is due to
unavoidable circumstances or conflicts discussed in advance by such director
with the Chairman of the Board. All members of the Board attended the 2003
annual meeting of shareholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Communication with the Board</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board provides a process for shareholders to send communications to
the Board. Information regarding the manner in which a shareholder may
communicate with the Board is included on our Internet web site at
http://www.ktron.com.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Requirements for Director Nominations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By resolution, the Board has adopted a policy regarding director
nominations. Under this policy, a majority of the Company&#146;s independent
directors shall recommend for the Board&#146;s selection a candidate or candidates,
as appropriate, to be the Board&#146;s nominee or nominees for election as a
director or directors, either at an annual meeting of shareholders or to fill a
vacancy. In considering candidates for nomination, the Board shall seek
individuals who evidence strength of character, mature judgment and the ability
to work collegially with others. Furthermore, it is the policy of the Board
that it endeavor to have directors who collectively possess a broad range of
skills, expertise, industry and other knowledge and business and other
experience useful to the effective oversight of the Company&#146;s business;
therefore, in considering whether to nominate a person for election as a
director, the independent directors and the Board will consider, among other
factors, the contribution such person can make to the collective competencies
of the Board based on such person&#146;s background. In determining whether to
nominate a current director for re-election, the Board will take into account
these same criteria as well as the director&#146;s past performance, including his
or her participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will also consider candidates for nomination recommended by
shareholders provided that the shareholder submits the recommendation, along
with the following information, to the Secretary of the Company at the
principal executive offices of the Company at least 120&nbsp;days before the date on
which the Company first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year&#146;s annual
meeting of shareholders: (a)&nbsp;the name of the candidate and the information
about the individual that would be required to be included in a proxy statement
under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission; (b)&nbsp;information

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;Ninth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
provides that no person may be nominated for election as a director by a
shareholder at an annual or special meeting unless written notice of such
shareholder&#146;s intent to make such nomination has been given, either by personal
delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the
Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than (i)
with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, 90
days in advance of such meeting and (ii)&nbsp;with respect to an election to be held
at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the close
of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such
meeting is first given to shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (a)
the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and
of the person or persons to be nominated; (b)&nbsp;a representation that the
shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at
such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c)&nbsp;a description of
all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and
any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which
the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d)&nbsp;such other
information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be
required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or
intended to be nominated, by the Board; and (e)&nbsp;the consent of each nominee to
serve as a director of the Company if so elected. The Board may, in its
discretion, consider nominees for the Board who are recommended by a
shareholder according to the foregoing procedure, but it is not obligated to do
so, and the chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of
any person not made in compliance with such procedure.

to time, and such additional compensation and bonus payments as may be awarded
to them. On February&nbsp;13, 2003, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee

termination by reason of the employee&#146;s death or disability or by the Board at
any time for &#147;cause&#148; as specified in the Employment Agreements. In addition,
the Company has the right to terminate either of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen or Remick at any
time without cause by paying him a lump sum amount equal to 100% of his
then-annual base salary or, if the previously described one-year notice of
termination has already been given by the Company to him, the portion thereof

and one-half percent increase to $475,000, effective April&nbsp;5, 2004, also on the
recommendation of the Compensation Committee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; employment agreement provides that he can terminate the
agreement upon not less than 90&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice. The Company may
terminate the employment term without cause upon not less than 30&nbsp;days&#146; prior
written notice to Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, in which case Mr.&nbsp;Cloues would be entitled to a
lump sum payment equal to 200% of his then-annual base salary. Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146;
employment term is also subject to termination by reason of his death or
disability or by the Board at any time for &#147;cause&#148; as specified in his
employment agreement. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; employment agreement includes
provisions relating to a termination of employment upon a &#147;change of control&#148;
(as specified in his employment agreement). These provisions apply to a
termination of employment upon or within one year after a &#147;change of control&#148;
which, if such termination was initiated by the Company or any successor
thereto, was for any reason other than death, disability or &#147;cause&#148; or which,
if such termination was initiated by Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, was at his sole discretion
without regard to reason. In the event of the termination of employment of Mr.
Cloues upon a &#147;change of control&#148; under any of these circumstances, his
employment agreement provides that, subject to certain limitations, the Company
would pay him (i)&nbsp;an amount equal to three times his annual base salary in
effect either immediately prior to the termination of employment or immediately
prior to the &#147;change of control,&#148; whichever is higher, and (ii)&nbsp;unless Mr.
Cloues notifies the Company in writing that he intends to retain his options,
an amount equal to the spread (the excess of market value over exercise price)
on any stock options then held by him, whether or not such options were
exercisable at the date of termination.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION<BR>
AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the &#147;Compensation
Committee&#148;) operates pursuant to a formal written charter that was approved and
adopted by the Board on March&nbsp;12, 2004 and complies with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National
Association of Securities Dealers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the Compensation Committee, it is our responsibility to
carry out the purposes of the Compensation Committee as more fully described on
page 6 of this Proxy Statement under the caption &#147;Matters Concerning Directors
&#150; Committees and Meetings&#148; and in the charter referred to above that is
included on our Internet web site at http://www.ktron.com. In particular, it
is our duty to establish base salary amounts and annual and long-term incentive
awards for the Named Executive Officers in this Proxy Statement and, in this
regard, we also constitute the committee (the &#147;Stock Option Committee&#148;) that
administers the Company&#146;s equity compensation plans, including the granting of
stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to officers and
other employees of the Company. In fulfilling these responsibilities and
duties, it is the Compensation Committee&#146;s goal to have a policy that will
enable the Company to attract, retain and reward senior officers who contribute
to both its short-term and long-term success. The two members of the
Compensation Committee meet the independence requirements applicable to
compensation committees generally as prescribed by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal
Revenue Service and also as set forth in the Compensation Committee&#146;s charter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s compensation policy for executive officers is to pay
competitively and to be fair and equitable in the administration of pay. This
is the same policy applicable to all employees of the Company. The Company
seeks to balance the compensation paid to a particular individual with the
compensation paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside
the Company and at other similar companies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisions of the Compensation Committee regarding salaries of the
Named Executive Officers are subjective and not based on any list of specific
criteria. The annual base salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Whalen and Melchiorre, who
joined the Company when Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation was acquired on
January&nbsp;2, 2003 and were designated as executive officers by the Board on March
14, 2003, remained unchanged during fiscal year 2003 at $252,668 and $199,992,
respectively. On February&nbsp;13, 2003, the Compensation Committee accepted the

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Executive Officer&#146;s recommendation that the salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen and
Remick be increased by approximately three percent each, effective March&nbsp;31,
2003. The Chief Executive Officer&#146;s recommendation to increase the base
salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen and Remick was based upon his assessment of their
contributions to the Company during fiscal year 2002. The Compensation
Committee also recommended to the Board a salary increase of approximately
three percent for the Chief Executive Officer, also to take effect on March&nbsp;31,
2003, which was subsequently approved by the Board. The recommendation of the
Compensation Committee to increase the base salary of Mr.&nbsp;Cloues was based upon
its assessment of his contributions to the Company during fiscal year 2002,
including the sharply improved financial performance of the Company, with
earnings per share increasing from $0.41 in fiscal year 2001 to $1.33 in fiscal
year 2002. The Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, had an annual
base salary of $436,800 from January&nbsp;1, 2001 until July&nbsp;1, 2002, an annual base
salary of $450,000 from July&nbsp;1, 2002 to March&nbsp;30, 2003 and an annual base
salary of $463,500 effective as of March&nbsp;31, 2003. The annual base salaries of
Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen and Remick during fiscal years 2002 and 2003 were as follows:
Mr.&nbsp;Bowen, $210,000 prior to July&nbsp;1, 2002, $216,300 effective from July&nbsp;1, 2002
to March&nbsp;30, 2003 and $222,800 effective as of March&nbsp;31, 2003; and Mr.&nbsp;Remick,
$191,000 prior to July&nbsp;1, 2002, $196,750 from July&nbsp;1, 2002 to March&nbsp;30, 2003
and $202,650 effective as of March&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Compensation Committee
accepted the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer and increased the
annual base salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Whalen, Bowen, Remick and Melchiorre by
approximately two and one-half percent each, effective April&nbsp;5, 2004, to
$259,000, $228,400, $207,700 and $205,000 respectively. The Chief Executive
Officer&#146;s salary recommendations for Messrs.&nbsp;Whalen, Bowen, Remick and
Melchiorre were based on many of the same factors considered by him in making
his bonus award recommendations for fiscal year 2003 for these persons, which
are described below. At the same time, the Compensation Committee recommended
to the Board that Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; annual base salary be increased by approximately
two and one-half percent to $475,000, also effective April&nbsp;5, 2004, and this
recommendation was approved by the Board. The factors that the Compensation
Committee took into account in recommending the Chief Executive Officer&#146;s
salary increase as of April&nbsp;5, 2004 were the same as those described below that
were the basis for Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; bonus for fiscal year 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with salary increases, the granting of bonuses on an annual basis is
also subjective and based on a number of different considerations, including
the individual&#146;s performance and the financial performance of the Company and
its various business units during the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2003, the
Compensation Committee approved an overall cash bonus pool of approximately
$1,156,000 for employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, based primarily
on a 12% earnings increase in fiscal year 2003 over fiscal year 2002 despite a
very difficult business environment for industrial capital equipment sales.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, received a $139,000
bonus for fiscal year 2003, which was equal to approximately 30% of his base
salary at the end of the year. In determining Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; bonus, the
Compensation Committee noted in particular the improved consolidated financial
performance in fiscal year 2003, the above average increase in the Company&#146;s
share price for the year, the successful integration of the January&nbsp;2, 2003
Pennsylvania Crusher acquisition and the completion of the globalization of the
K-Tron Feeder Group. The bonus awards made to the four other Named Executive
Officers were recommended by Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, based on his assessment of their
contributions to the Company in fiscal year 2003, and approved by the
Compensation Committee. For Messrs.&nbsp;Whalen, Bowen, Remick and Melchiorre,
respectively, their bonuses for fiscal year 2003 equaled approximately 22.5%,
18%, 18% and 22.5% of each of their base salaries at the end of fiscal year
2003, not including certain payments that were received by Messrs.&nbsp;Whalen and
Melchiorre ($11,203 and $13,823, respectively) under a profit-sharing plan of
an acquired subsidiary (Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation) that was discontinued
at the end of fiscal year 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the members of the Compensation Committee also serve as
the members of the Stock Option Committee that administers the 1996 Equity
Compensation Plan under which grants of stock options, stock appreciation
rights and restricted stock may be made. The purpose of such grants is to
provide an additional incentive to key employees to work to maximize
shareholder value, and vesting periods may be utilized to encourage such
employees to remain with the Company. Such grants are entirely at the
discretion of the Stock Option Committee, including their timing, the
recipients thereof and the number of shares underlying any particular grant.
No stock options, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock awards were
granted to any Named Executive Officer or to any other Company employee in
fiscal year 2002 or 2003.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, we believe that the combination of salary and bonus received
by each of the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2003 was reasonable in
view of their duties and responsibilities and their past and anticipated future
contributions to the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fiscal year 2004, the Compensation Committee has not adopted or made
any recommendation to the full Board regarding a bonus or other incentive
compensation program, but it is anticipated that the same principles that
applied to the program in fiscal year 2003 will likely apply in fiscal year
2004. Furthermore, it is contemplated that any stock options or awards that
may be granted will be granted on a case-by-case basis, as and when deemed
appropriate.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a formal written charter that was
most recently approved and adopted by the Board on March&nbsp;12, 2004 and complies
with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
National Association of Securities Dealers (the &#147;NASD&#148;). A copy of the charter
is attached as Appendix&nbsp;A to this Proxy Statement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with that charter and the independence criteria prescribed
by applicable law and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for audit committee membership, all of the members of the Audit
Committee are independent directors as defined in NASD Marketplace Rule
4200(a)(15). Each Audit Committee member meets the NASD&#146;s financial knowledge
requirements, and Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola and Engel, each of whom has been designated by
the Board as an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; pursuant to the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, meet the NASD&#146;s professional experience
requirements as well.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of the Audit Committee are described on page 6 of this Proxy
Statement under the caption &#147;Matters Concerning Directors &#150; Committees and
Meetings&#148; and in the charter of the Audit Committee. In particular, it is our
duty to review the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company
on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling our responsibilities, the Audit
Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial
statements to be contained in the Company&#146;s annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January&nbsp;3, 2004 with the Company&#146;s management and also with
Grant Thornton LLP, the Company&#146;s independent auditors. Management is
responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including
the system of internal controls, and has represented to the Audit Committee
that such financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The independent auditors are responsible for
expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee has also discussed with Grant Thornton LLP the matters
that are required to be discussed by the auditors with the Audit Committee
under Statement on Auditing Standards No.&nbsp;61, as amended. Furthermore, the
Audit Committee has received and discussed with the auditors their annual
written report on their independence from the Company and its management, which
is made under Rule&nbsp;3600T of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
which adopts on an interim basis Independence Standards Board Standard No.&nbsp;1
(independence discussions with audit committees), and has considered with Grant
Thornton LLP whether the provision of non-audit services to the Company would
be compatible with the auditors&#146; independence (no such non-audit services were
provided in fiscal year 2003).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts in an
oversight capacity. The Audit Committee reviews the Company&#146;s earnings releases
before issuance and the annual report on Form 10-K prior to filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. In its oversight role, the Audit Committee
relies on the work and assurances of the Company&#146;s management, which has the
primary responsibility for financial statements and reports, and of the
independent auditors, who, in their report, express an opinion on the
conformity of the Company&#146;s annual financial statements to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;13, 2003, the Audit Committee of the Board, pursuant to
authority delegated to it by the Board, dismissed KPMG LLP (&#147;KPMG&#148;) as the
Company&#146;s independent auditors and engaged Grant Thornton LLP (&#147;Grant
Thornton&#148;) to serve as the Company&#146;s independent auditors for the 2003 fiscal
year ending January&nbsp;3, 2004. KPMG audited the Company&#146;s financial statements
for fiscal year 2002 and had been the Company&#146;s independent auditors since June
22, 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;22, 2002, the Board, following a recommendation from the Audit
Committee, dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP (&#147;Andersen&#148;) as the Company&#146;s
independent public accountants and auditors and engaged KPMG to serve as the
Company&#146;s independent auditors for the 2002 fiscal year ending December&nbsp;28,
2002. Andersen audited the Company&#146;s financial statements for fiscal year 2001
and had been the Company&#146;s independent public accountants and auditors since
1994.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;28, 2002, KPMG&#146;s report on the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements did not contain an adverse opinion
or a disclaimer of opinion, and it was not qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that it contained a
separate paragraph as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;As discussed above, the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of K-Tron International, Inc. and subsidiaries were
audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As
described in Note 7, these consolidated financial statements
have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142, &#145;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,&#146; which was adopted
by the Company as of December&nbsp;30, 2001. In our opinion, such
disclosures for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 in Note 7 are
appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or
apply any procedures to the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of K-Tron International, Inc. and subsidiaries other
than with respect to such disclosures, and, accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;30, 2001, Andersen&#146;s report on the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements did not contain an adverse opinion
or a disclaimer of opinion, and it was not qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;28, 2002 and through August&nbsp;13,
2003, and during the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;30, 2001 and through June&nbsp;22,
2002, there were no disagreements with KPMG or Andersen, respectively, on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
respective former auditors&#146; and accountants&#146; satisfaction, would have caused
the former auditors or accountants to make reference to the subject matter of
the disagreements in connection with any of their respective reports on the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for such years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company disclosed the foregoing information with respect to KPMG in a
current report on Form 8-K filed August&nbsp;20, 2003 and amended in a current
report on Form 8-K/A filed August&nbsp;25, 2003 (collectively, the &#147;KPMG Form&nbsp;8-K&#148;).
The Company provided KPMG with a copy of this disclosure and requested KPMG to
furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission stating whether KPMG agreed with the statements in the disclosure
and, if not, stating the respects in which it did not agree. KPMG&#146;s letter
stated that it had read the pertinent paragraphs of the KPMG Form 8-K and was
in agreement with the statements contained therein, except that KPMG said that
it was not in a position to agree or disagree with the Company&#146;s statement that
Grant Thornton was not engaged regarding the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction or the type of audit opinion that might
be rendered on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. KPMG&#146;s letter
was filed as an exhibit to the KPMG Form 8-K.

retained. No representative of Grant Thornton is expected to attend the Annual
