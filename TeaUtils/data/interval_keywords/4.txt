                         ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                             TO BE HELD MAY 16, 2003

                               -------------------


        This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the shareholders of K-Tron
International, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders of the Company to be held on May 16, 2003 and any postponements or
adjournments thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the
enclosed Proxy Card are being mailed to shareholders on or about April 4, 2003.

        Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card are being solicited by
and on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") for the
purposes set forth in the foregoing notice of meeting. The costs incidental to
the solicitation and obtaining of proxies, including the cost of reimbursing
banks and brokers for forwarding proxy materials to their principals, will be
borne by the Company. Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by
officers and employees of the Company, both in person and by mail, telephone,
telefax and other methods of communication.

        The Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 28,
2002, including consolidated financial statements and other information with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, is being mailed to shareholders
with this Proxy Statement. Such Annual Report is not part of this Proxy
Statement.

                              VOTING AT THE MEETING

        Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2003
are entitled to notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting.
As of that date, the Company had outstanding 2,432,666 shares of Common Stock.
The holders of a majority of such shares, represented in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is necessary before
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting except that, even if a quorum
is not present, the shareholders present in person or by proxy shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Each
shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to one vote for each share of
Common Stock outstanding in such shareholder's name.

        The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed Proxy
Card will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the
shareholder signing such Proxy Card. The Proxy Card provides space for a
shareholder to vote for the nominee, or to withhold authority to vote for the
nominee, for the Board. The nominee for election as a director is to be elected
by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. With respect to any
other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to
vote thereon is required to take action, unless a greater percentage is required
either by law or by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws. In determining the number of votes cast with respect to any voting
matter, only those cast "for" or "against" are included. Abstentions will be
considered present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be
counted as votes cast. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on the vote.
Similarly, where brokers submit proxies but are prohibited and thus refrain from
exercising discretionary authority in voting shares on certain matters for
beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions with respect to such
matters (commonly referred to as


<PAGE>


"broker non-votes"), those shares will be considered present and entitled to
vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be counted as votes cast as to such
matters and thus will have no effect on the vote.

        If a signed Proxy Card is returned and the shareholder has given no
direction with respect to a voting matter, the shares will be voted with respect
to that matter by the proxy agents as recommended by the Board or its Executive
Committee. Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card will not affect a
shareholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. Any
shareholder that executes and returns a Proxy Card has the right to revoke it by
giving notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time before
the proxy is voted.

                 SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS
                 AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

        The following table sets forth certain information as of March 19, 2003
(or as of such other dates as are indicated in footnotes 6 through 11 to such
table) with respect to shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each
director of the Company, by each executive officer of the Company named in the
Summary Compensation Table under "Executive Compensation," by all directors and
executive officers of the Company as a group and by each person believed by the
Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock. Except as indicated below, the Company understands that the
shareholders listed in such table have sole voting and investment power with
respect to the shares owned by them. The number of shares in the table below
includes shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options to the
extent that such options are exercisable by the director, executive officer or
shareholder on or within 60 days after March 19, 2003. In the case of directors
and executive officers, the information below has been provided by such persons
at the request of the Company.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

        The Board currently consists of five directors and is classified with
respect to terms of office into four classes. The Class II director elected at
the Annual Meeting will serve until the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders and
until such director's successor has been elected and qualified, except in the
event of such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. The terms of
office of the Class I, Class III and Class IV directors will expire at the
annual meetings to be held in 2006, 2004 and 2005, respectively, upon the
election and qualification of their successors.

        The Board has nominated Mr. Robert A. Engel for election as the Class II
director. Mr. Engel currently is a director of the Company. The persons named as
proxy agents in the enclosed Proxy Card intend (unless instructed otherwise by a
shareholder) to vote for the election of Mr. Engel as the Class II director. In
the event that the nominee should become unable to accept nomination or election
(a circumstance that the Board does not expect), the proxy agents intend to vote
for any alternate nominee designated by the Board or its Executive Committee or,
in the discretion of the Board or its Executive Committee, the position may be
left vacant.

        THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE CLASS II NOMINEE.

        Set forth below is certain information with respect to the nominee for
director and each other person currently serving as a director of the Company
whose term of office will continue after the Annual Meeting, including the class
and term of office of each such person. This information has been provided by

COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS

        The Board has an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and a
Compensation and Human Resources Committee. The members of the Compensation and
Human Resources Committee also constitute the members of the two committees that
administer the Company's equity compensation plans (collectively, the "Stock
Option Committee"). During fiscal year 2002, the Board held six meetings
(including one by telephone conference), the Audit Committee held three meetings
(including one by telephone conference), the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee held two meetings (including one by telephone conference), the Stock
Option Committee did not meet separately from the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee and the Executive Committee met

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

once by telephone conference. Each director attended at least 75% of the
aggregate of the fiscal year 2002 meetings of the Board and of the Board
committee or committees on which he served during the year. The Company had a
Nominating Committee until the death of one its members in 2001; since that
time, the full Board has assumed the responsibilities of the Nominating
Committee.

        The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of the
Board, except action on dividends and certain other matters that cannot by law
be delegated by the Board, during the periods between regular Board meetings.
The primary duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to serve as
an independent and objective party to monitor the Company's financial reporting
process and internal control systems, review the independence and performance of
the Company's independent accountants, and provide an open avenue of
communication among the independent accountants, financial and senior management
of the Company and the Board. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee
recommends to the Board the annual salary of the Company's chief executive
officer and approves the granting of any bonus to the chief executive officer,
reviews and takes action on the chief executive officer's recommendations
regarding the appropriate compensation of the Company's other executive officers
and also of any other direct reports to the chief executive officer, approves
the granting of any bonuses to such officers and direct reports and the total
size of any Company-wide bonus pool, reviews other compensation and personnel
development matters generally and recommends to the Board the compensation of
non-employee directors. The Nominating Committee's principal duties, which have
been assumed by the full Board as indicated above, are to recommend to the Board
nominees for election as directors, changes in the membership of the committees
of the Board and the membership of any newly-created Board committee. The Stock
Option Committee is responsible for administering the Company's 1996 Equity
Compensation Plan and another stock option plan that has expired (but under
which there remain outstanding stock options).

        The current members of the Executive Committee are Messrs. Cloues
(Chairman) and Cohen; of the Audit Committee, Messrs. Pinola (Chairman), Engel
and Hurd; of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, Messrs. Cohen
(Chairman) and Pinola; and of the Stock Option Committee, Messrs. Cohen and
Pinola.

STANDARD COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

        Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual
retainer of $15,000 (effective as of July 1, 2002), a $2,000 annual retainer for
each membership on the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee, a $1,000 annual retainer for membership on the Executive Committee,
$1,000 for each Board meeting attended and $750 for each Executive Committee
meeting attended provided that, in the case of an Executive Committee meeting,
such meeting either requires substantial preparation or lasts for two hours or
more. In addition, the chairman of the Audit Committee and the chairman of the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee are each paid an additional $1,500
for their service in such capacities. All retainers are paid on a prorated
bi-monthly basis. Directors generally do not receive compensation for their
participation in telephone meetings or for attendance at other committee
meetings. Under the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan, non-employee directors are
eligible to receive stock options and, unless the Stock Option Committee
determines otherwise (which has not been the case in the past), on the date of
each annual meeting of shareholders of the Company, each non-employee director
receives a stock option grant to purchase 1,000 shares of Common Stock with an
option price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock
on that date. Such options are fully vested on the date of grant and have a
ten-year term.

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE

        Each non-employee director is required to own shares of Common Stock
with a value, at the greater of cost or market, equal to $50,000. As for any
newly-elected director, this requirement may be phased in over a period of time
to be determined by the Board. All directors are in compliance with this
guideline with the exception of the two most recently-elected directors, Messrs.
Engel and Hurd, who as of March 19, 2003 owned 2,500 shares and 1,000 shares,
respectively.

REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF NOMINATIONS

        Article Ninth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company provides that no person may be nominated for election as a director by a
shareholder at an annual or special meeting unless written notice of such

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

shareholder's intent to make such nomination has been given, either by personal
delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the
Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than (i)
with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, 90
days in advance of such meeting and (ii) with respect to an election to be held
at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the close of
business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting
is first given to shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name
and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the
person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the shareholder is
a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or
understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or
nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d) such other information
regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be
included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended
to be nominated, by the Board; and (e) the consent of each nominee to serve as a
director of the Company if so elected. The Board may, in its discretion,
consider nominees for the Board who are recommended by a shareholder according
to the foregoing procedure, but it is not obligated to do so, and the chairman
of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made
in compliance with such procedure.

CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

        Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt were employed by the Company or a
subsidiary during fiscal year 2002 under employment agreements with the Company
(the "Employment Agreements"). Under the Employment Agreements, Messrs. Bowen,
Remick and Guenthardt are entitled to receive a base salary, which may be
increased from time to time, and such additional compensation and bonus payments
as may be awarded to them. During all of fiscal year 2001 and the first half of
fiscal year 2002, the annual base salaries for Messrs. Bowen, Remick and
Guenthardt were $210,000, $191,000 and $185,500, respectively. Effective July 1,
2002, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Compensation
Committee") approved a three percent increase in the annual base salaries for
Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt to $216,300, $196,750 and $191,100,
respectively, and on February 13, 2003, the Compensation Committee approved an
additional three percent increase to $222,800, $202,650 and $196,850,
respectively, effective March 31, 2003. The Company's obligation to pay such
base salaries is subject to its right to reduce them in the event reductions are
generally being made for other officers of the Company or its subsidiaries
holding comparable positions.

        Each of the Employment Agreements provides that either the Company or
the employee may terminate the employment term thereunder upon not less than one
year's prior written notice. Such employment terms are also subject to
termination by reason of the employee's death or disability or by the Board at
any time for "cause" as specified in the Employment Agreements. In addition, the
Company has the right to terminate any of Messrs. Bowen, Remick or Guenthardt at
any time without cause by paying him a lump sum amount equal to 100% of his
then-annual base salary or, if the previously described one-year notice of
termination has already been given by the Company to him, the portion thereof
relating to the balance of the employment term.

        Mr. Cloues was employed by the Company during fiscal year 2002 under an
employment agreement with the Company pursuant to which he served as the
Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. During all of
fiscal year 2001 and the first half of fiscal year 2002, Mr. Cloues' annual base
salary was $436,800. Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the
Board approved a three percent increase in the annual base salary of Mr. Cloues
to $450,000, effective July 1, 2002, and on March 14, 2003, the Board approved
an additional three percent increase to $463,500 as of March 31, 2003.

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

        Mr. Cloues' employment agreement provides that he can terminate the
agreement upon not less than 90 days' prior written notice. The Company may
terminate the employment term without cause upon not less than 30 days' prior
written notice to Mr. Cloues, in which case Mr. Cloues would be entitled to a
lump sum payment equal to 200% of his then-annual base salary. Mr. Cloues'
employment term is also subject to termination by reason of his death or
disability or by the Board at any time for "cause" as specified in his
employment agreement. In addition, Mr. Cloues' employment agreement includes
provisions relating to a termination of employment upon a "change of control"
(as specified in his employment agreement). These provisions apply to a
termination of employment upon or within one year after a "change of control"
which, if such termination was initiated by the Company or any successor
thereto, was for any reason other than death, disability or "cause" or which, if
such termination was initiated by Mr. Cloues, was at his sole discretion without
regard to reason. In the event of the termination of employment of Mr. Cloues
upon a "change of control" under any of these circumstances, his employment
agreement provides that, subject to certain limitations, the Company would pay
him (i) an amount equal to three times his annual base salary in effect either
immediately prior to the termination of employment or immediately prior to the
"change of control," whichever is higher, and (ii) unless Mr. Cloues notifies
the Company in writing that he intends to retain his options, an amount equal to
the spread (the excess of market value over exercise price) on any stock options
then held by him, whether or not such options were exercisable at the date of
termination.

        NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, THE FOLLOWING REPORTS OF THE
        COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
        AND THE PERFORMANCE GRAPH ON PAGE 15 SHALL NOT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY
        REFERENCE BY ANY GENERAL STATEMENT INCORPORATING BY REFERENCE THIS PROXY
        STATEMENT INTO ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
        OR UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, EXCEPT TO THE
        EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY INCORPORATES THIS INFORMATION BY
        REFERENCE, AND SHALL NOT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED FILED UNDER SUCH ACTS.

                           REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION
                          AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE

        As members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the
"Compensation Committee"), it is our duty to review the compensation paid to the
Company's Named Executive Officers and the other material benefits received by
them, to recommend to the full Board the annual base salary of the Company's
Chief Executive Officer, to approve the annual base salaries of the other Named
Executive Officers and direct reports to the Chief Executive Officer, to approve
all bonuses and other material compensation granted to the Chief Executive
Officer and other Named Executive Officers and direct reports to the Chief
Executive Officer and to approve the total amount of all bonuses paid by the
Company under any Company-wide bonus or other incentive compensation program. In
addition, we also constitute the committee (the "Stock Option Committee") that
administers the Company's equity compensation plans, including the granting of
stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to officers and
other employees of the Company. These duties and the other responsibilities of
the Compensation Committee are more fully described on page 6 of this Proxy
Statement under the caption "Matters Concerning Directors - Committees and
Meetings." In fulfilling these duties and responsibilities, it is the
Compensation Committee's goal to have a policy that will enable the Company to
attract, retain and reward senior officers who contribute to both its short-term
and long-term success. Both members of the Compensation Committee are
independent directors.

        The Company's compensation policy for executive officers is to pay
competitively and to be fair and equitable in the administration of pay. This is
the same policy applicable to all employees of the Company. The Company seeks to
balance the compensation paid to a particular individual with the compensation
paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside the Company
and at other similar companies.

        The granting of bonuses on an annual basis is subjective and is based on
a number of factors, including the individual's performance and the financial
performance of the Company and its various business units during the fiscal
year. No bonuses were paid in either fiscal year 2001 or fiscal year 2000. For
fiscal year 2002, the Compensation Committee approved an overall cash bonus pool
for all employees of the Company of approximately $993,000, based in large part
on the Company's increase in earnings per share from $0.43 in fiscal year 2001
to

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

$1.33 in fiscal year 2002. All bonuses were paid in cash, and, except for the
Chief Executive Officer, each Named Executive Officer's award was based on the
Chief Executive Officer's recommendation to the Compensation Committee.

        Edward B. Cloues, II, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, received a
$168,750 bonus for fiscal year 2002, which was equal to 37.5% of his base salary
at the end of the year. Mr. Cloues' bonus reflected the Compensation Committee's
recognition of the key role that he played during fiscal years 2001 (when no
bonuses were awarded) and 2002, particularly in connection with the sale of the
Hasler heavy feeder business in July 2001, the implementation of major cost
reduction initiatives in the second half of 2001, the sharply improved financial
performance of the Company in fiscal year 2002 despite a weak capital equipment
spending environment and the acquisition of Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation on
January 2, 2003. The awards made to the other three Named Executive Officers of
the Company were recommended by Mr. Cloues and approved by the Compensation
Committee, and they equaled approximately 24% of each of their base salaries at
the end of 2002.

        As with bonuses, the decisions of the Compensation Committee regarding
salaries are subjective and not based on any list of specific criteria. In 2002,
the Compensation Committee accepted the Chief Executive Officer's recommendation
that his salary, along with the salaries of Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt
and the other employees of the Company, not be increased from the January 1,
2001 level for the first six months of fiscal year 2002 except, in the case of
other employees, for promotions or other exceptional circumstances. In the
second quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Compensation Committee accepted the
Chief Executive Officer's recommendation that the salaries of Messrs. Bowen,
Remick and Guenthardt be increased by three percent effective as of July 1, 2002
and also that future salary adjustments be determined during the first quarter
of a year and made effective at the beginning of the second quarter. The Chief
Executive Officer's recommendation to increase the base salaries of Messrs.
Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt was based upon his assessment of their
contributions to the Company since January 1, 2001. The Compensation Committee
also recommended to the Board a three percent salary increase for the Chief
Executive Officer, which was subsequently approved by the Board. The
recommendation of the Compensation Committee to increase the base salary of Mr.
Cloues was based upon its assessment of his contributions to the Company since
January 1, 2001, including the sale of the Hasler heavy feeder business in July
2001 and the implementation of cost reduction initiatives in the second half of
2001. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Edward B. Cloues, II, had an annual
base salary of $436,800 from January 1, 2001 until July 1, 2002 and an annual
base salary of $450,000 effective as of July 1, 2002. The annual base salaries
of the other three Named Executive Officers during fiscal years 2001 and 2002
were as follows: Mr. Bowen, $210,000 prior to July 1, 2002 and $216,300
effective as of July 1, 2002; Mr. Remick, $191,000 prior to July 1, 2002 and
$196,750 effective as of July 1, 2002; and Mr. Guenthardt, $185,500 prior to
July 1, 2002 and $191,100 effective as of July 1, 2002.

        In the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, the Compensation Committee
accepted the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer and increased the
annual base salaries of Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt by another three
percent, effective March 31, 2003, to $222,800, $202,650 and $196,850,
respectively. At the same time, the Compensation Committee recommended to the
Board that Mr. Cloues' annual base salary be increased by three percent to
$463,500, also effective March 31, 2003, and this recommendation was approved by
the Board. The Compensation Committee accepted the Chief Executive Officer's
salary recommendations for Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt, which were
based on many of the same factors considered by the Chief Executive Officer in
making his bonus award recommendations for 2002. The same was also true of the
factors that the Compensation Committee took into account in determining the
Chief Executive Officer's salary as of March 31, 2003.

        As stated above, the members of the Compensation Committee also serve as
the members of the Stock Option Committee that administers the 1996 Equity
Compensation Plan providing for grants of stock options, stock appreciation
rights and restricted stock. The purpose of such grants is to provide an
additional incentive to key employees to work to maximize shareholder value, and
vesting periods may be utilized to encourage such employees to remain with the
Company. Such grants are entirely at the discretion of the Stock Option
Committee, including their timing, the recipients thereof and the number of
shares underlying any particular grant. No stock options, stock appreciation
rights or restricted stock awards were granted to any Named Executive Officer or
to any other Company employee in fiscal year 2002.

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

        In summary, we believe that the combination of salary and bonus received
by each of the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2002 was reasonable in
view of their duties and responsibilities and their past and anticipated future
contributions to the Company.

        For fiscal year 2003, the Compensation Committee has not adopted or made
any recommendation to the full Board regarding a bonus or other incentive
compensation program, but it is anticipated that the same principles that
applied to the program in fiscal year 2002 will likely apply in fiscal year
2003. Furthermore, it is contemplated that any stock options or awards that may
be granted will be granted on a case-by-case basis, as and when deemed
appropriate, rather than as part of any specific program.

                          REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

        The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a formal written charter that
was approved and adopted by the Board on May 15, 2000. In accordance with that
charter, all of the members of the Audit Committee are independent directors,
and the Audit Committee considered the adequacy of the charter during fiscal
year 2002 and determined that no changes were necessary at that time.

        The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on
behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee has
reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements to be
contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 28, 2002 with the Company's management and also with KPMG LLP, the
Company's independent auditors. Management is responsible for the financial
statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls,
and has represented to the Audit Committee that such financial statements were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
independent auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity
of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

        The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters that
are required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as
amended. Furthermore, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures
and the letter from KPMG LLP that are required by Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), and the Audit
Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP that firm's independence from the Company
and its management.

AUDIT FEES

        The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP
for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended
December 28, 2002 and the reviews of the Company's financial statements included
in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the year ended December 28,
2002 were $123,700.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

        There were no fees billed for any professional services rendered by KPMG
LLP during fiscal year 2002 relating to financial information systems design and
implementation, nor were any such services rendered.



                                      -13-
<PAGE>



ALL OTHER FEES

        The aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered by KPMG LLP
during fiscal year 2002, other than the services referred to above under the
captions "Audit Fees" and "Financial Information Systems Design and
Implementation Fees," were $24,500, and such other fees were for the preparation
of the Company's U.S. federal and certain state and foreign income tax returns
and for tax advice given to the Company.

        After considering the provision of services encompassed within the above
disclosures about fees (under the captions "Financial Information Systems Design
and Implementation Fees" and "All Other Fees"), the Audit Committee has
determined that the provision of such services was and is compatible with
maintaining KPMG LLP's independence.

        Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit
Committee has recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated
financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002 to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

        On June 22, 2002, the Board, following a recommendation of the Audit
Committee, decided to no longer engage Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as the
Company's independent public accountants and auditors and engaged KPMG LLP to
serve as the Company's independent public accountants and auditors for the
fiscal year ending December 28, 2002. Andersen audited the Company's financial
statements for fiscal years 2001 and 2000 and had been the Company's independent
public accountants and auditors since 1994.

        Andersen's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements as
of and for each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001 and December 30,
2000 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were
they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles.

        During the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000
and through June 22, 2002, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Andersen's
satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of
the disagreements in connection with any of its reports on the Company's
consolidated financial statements for such years; and there were no reportable
events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

        The Company disclosed the foregoing information on a Current Report on
Form 8-K dated June 22, 2002 (the "Form 8-K"). The Company provided Andersen
with a copy of the foregoing disclosure and requested Andersen to furnish the
Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission
stating whether Andersen agreed with the statements by the Company in the
foregoing disclosure and, if not, stating the respects in which it did not
agree. Andersen's letter stated that it had read the pertinent paragraphs of the
Form 8-K and was in agreement with the statements contained therein. Andersen's
letter was filed as an exhibit to the Form 8-K.

        During the fiscal years ended December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000
and through June 22, 2002, the Company had not consulted with KPMG LLP with
respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction,
either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be
rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other
matters or reportable events set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of
Regulation S-K.

        The retention of KPMG LLP to serve as the Company's independent public
accountants and auditors for the current year has not yet been considered by the
Board, but it is management's expectation that KPMG LLP will be so retained. A

the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and to be
available to respond to appropriate questions.

        Shareholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for shareholder
action at annual meetings in accordance with regulations adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Any proposal which an eligible shareholder
desires to have presented at the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders (which is
expected to be held on or about May 14, 2004) concerning a proper subject for
inclusion in the proxy statement and for consideration at the annual meeting,
will be included in the Company's proxy statement and related proxy card if it
is received by the Company no later than December 3, 2003.

             SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

        Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires that directors and certain officers of the Company, and persons who own
more than ten percent of the Common Stock, file reports of ownership of Company
securities and changes in ownership of Company's securities with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that all filings required to be
made during fiscal year 2002 were made on a timely basis.
