                      2000 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

Dear Stockholder:

     On behalf of the Board of Directors, I cordially invite you to attend the
2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of ACCEL International Corporation (the
"Corporation" or "ACCEL") to be held at 10:00 a.m., local time on September 7,
2000, at the offices of Day, Berry & Howard LLP, 25th floor, CityPlace I,
Hartford, Connecticut. A notice of the meeting, a proxy statement and a proxy
card accompany this letter.

     At the meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following:

     - the election of our directors to serve until our next annual meeting;

     - proposed amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in the
       forms attached as Appendices A and B to the proxy statement; and

     - proposed amendments to our 1996 Stock Incentive Plan in the form attached
       as as Appendix C.

     The proposed amendment and restatement of our Certificate of Incorporation,
if adopted, would:

     - increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 15 million
       shares to 30 million shares;

     - eliminate the prohibition against stockholder action without a meeting;

     - eliminate some anti-takeover and supermajority vote provisions; and

     - reduce the minimum number of directors of the Corporation from nine to
       seven.

     The proposed amendment to our Bylaws, if approved, would:

     - permit the bylaws to be made, repealed, altered, amended or rescinded by
       the vote of our stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares
       entitled to elect directors, rather than by stockholders holding 80% of
       the shares as currently required;

     - decrease the stockholder vote necessary to approve an amendment to our
       Certificate of Incorporation that would contravene any bylaw, from the
       vote of stockholders holding 80% or more of our outstanding shares
       entitled to elect directors, to the vote of the holders of only a
       majority of the shares; and

     - permit the Board of Directors to designate the date, time and place of
       all meetings of stockholders.

    The proposed amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws will
    require the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more of the
    outstanding shares.

     The proposed amendments to the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, if approved,
would:

     - increase the total number of shares of common stock with respect to which
       awards may be granted from 1,500,000 to 2,500,000, and Directors stock
       options from 500,000 to 750,000; and

     - provide that the Board of Directors by unanimous vote may grant up to
       150,000 stock options with an option price not less than $ 2.00 to an
       outside director who, in the opinion of the Board, performs services for
       the Corporation or its subsidiaries not contemplated by Director fees or
       other grants in the Plan. This action may only be taken independently by
       the Board excluding the Director receiving the special grant. Director
       stock options granted are provided at an option price of not less than
       $2.00.

The proposed amendments to the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan will require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of the shares voting in person or
by proxy at the meeting.

     Your Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of the
nominees for director, FOR the amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws, and FOR the amendments to our 1996 Stock Incentive Plan.

          majority of the shares; and

     (g)  permit the Board of Directors to designate the date, time and place of

     (a)  increase the total number of shares of common stock with respect to
          which awards may be granted from 1,500,000 to 2,500,000, and Directors

          outside director who, in the opinion of the Board, performs services
          for the Corporation or its subsidiaries not contemplated by Director
          fees or other grants in the Plan. This action may only be taken
          independently by the Board excluding the Director receiving the
          special grant. Director stock options granted are provided at an
          option price of not less than $2.00.


The stockholders will also consider and vote upon such other matters as may
properly be brought before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

VOTE REQUIRED

     A plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote will elect directors. This means that the directors
receiving

                                                                         Page 10
<PAGE>   12
the greatest number of votes cast will be elected. With regard to the election
of directors, you may vote in favor of or withhold your vote from each nominee;
and votes that are withheld will be excluded entirely from the vote and will
have no effect. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of
directors.

         The proposal to amend the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws will
pass if the holders of 80% or more of our outstanding shares entitled to elect
directors vote in favor.

     The proposal to amend the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan will pass upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares voting in person or
by proxy at the meeting.

     Pursuant to applicable law, broker non-votes and abstentions will not be
counted in favor of any proposal presented at the meeting or the election of any
nominee for director. If you abstain from voting on the proposal to amend the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, then you will in effect be voting
against it. Broker non-votes will also have the same effect as a negative vote
on the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count against the
proposals to amend the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan and to elect directors.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     Shares of our common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received in time for the meeting, unless previously revoked, will be voted at
the meeting as specified by the stockholders on the proxies. If no specification
is made, shares represented by these proxies will be voted as recommended by
your Board of Directors.

     If any other matters properly come before the meeting for consideration,
the person or persons named in the form of proxy enclosed herewith and acting
thereunder will have discretion to vote on the matters in accordance with their
best judgment, unless the proxy indicates otherwise. We have no knowledge of any
matters to be presented at the meeting other than those matters referred to and
described in this proxy statement.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     If you give a proxy, you have the power to revoke it at any time before it
is voted by a later appointment received by our Secretary or by giving notice of
revocation to our Secretary in writing or in open meeting.

RECORD DATE; STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM

     Only stockholders of record at the close of business on July 14, 2000, will
be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the record
date, 9,084,004 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Each share
of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter on which the holders of
common stock are entitled to vote. A majority of the outstanding shares of
common stock entitled to vote must be represented in person or by proxy at the
meeting in order for a quorum to be present.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Your Board of Directors is soliciting proxies, the form of which is
enclosed, for the meeting. The cost of this solicitation will be borne by us. We
have hired Corporate Investor Communications, Inc. to solicit proxies for us at
a fee of $4,500 plus expenses. Our officers, directors, regular employees or
individuals from the firm hired by us may communicate with stockholders
personally or by mail, telephone, telegram or otherwise for the purpose of
soliciting proxies. We and our authorized agents will request brokers and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy soliciting material to the
beneficial owners of shares held of record by these persons and will reimburse
their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding the material. This proxy
statement is being mailed on or about August 4, 2000.

                     PROPOSAL NO. 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

NOMINEES FOR DIRECTORS

     In accordance with our Bylaws, the Board of Directors has fixed the number
of directors at nine. Directors are elected annually to serve until the next
annual meeting of stockholders, and until their successors are elected and
qualified. The election of directors is decided by a plurality of the votes cast
by the shares entitled to vote in the election. In the absence of instructions
to the contrary, the persons named in the proxy intend to vote the proxies for
the election as directors of the persons nominated below. Although the Board of
Directors has no reason to believe that any of the nominees set forth below will
not serve, in the event that vacancies occur, the proxies will be voted for the
election of the nominees, if any, which the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee of it may designate.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     During 1999, we continued to pay our non-employee directors at the reduced
compensation levels initiated in 1993. Accordingly our non-employee directors
received an annual retainer of $5,000 plus a fee of $500 per meeting for
attending any regular or special meetings of the Board of Directors. The members
of each committee of the Board of Directors, other than officers of ACCEL,
received a fee of $500 for each meeting attended. Chairmen of committees
received a fee of $750 for each meeting attended.

     On October 1, 1999 Mr. Deck, an outside director, was appointed Chairman of
the Board. Mr. Deck's compensation as executive chairman was established at
$100,000 annually and continued at that rate during 2000.

     The 1996 Stock Incentive Plan of ACCEL International Corporation provides
for options to be granted every year to our non-employee directors for a
predetermined number of shares of common stock. This plan, as amended by the
stockholders in 1998, provides that newly appointed or elected non-employee
directors are granted options for 10,000 shares in the year they are appointed
or elected, and thereafter will receive annual automatic grants of options to
purchase 10,000 shares. The exercise price is equal to the fair market value of
a share of stock on the date the option is granted. Options become exercisable
as to 50% of the shares subject to the option on completion of each full year
prior to termination of the director's status as director after the date the
option was granted. The options lapse on the earliest of the date 10 years after
the option was granted, or the date 180 days after the termination of the
director's status as director. The options shall fully vest and become
completely exercisable upon the death or voluntary retirement of a director.

Compensation Committee. It does not have a Nominating Committee.

     The Executive Committee, which exercises the powers of the Board of
Directors between regular meetings of the Board, did not meet during 1999. The
membership of the Executive Committee consists of Messrs. Chase, Deck, Desich,
Pastor and Redding.

     The Audit Committee did not meet during 1999. The membership of the Audit
Committee consists of Messrs. Deck, Desich and Grusse.

     The Compensation Committee did not meet during 1999 for the purposes of
reviewing employee compensation and benefit arrangements. The membership of the

PROPOSAL NO. 2 - AMENDMENTS TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

GENERAL

     The Board of Directors has approved and recommends that you approve and
adopt the amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation of ACCEL attached as
Appendix A to this proxy statement and the amendments to ACCEL's bylaws attached
as Appendix B to this proxy statement. The changes to the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws will:

     -    increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 15
          million shares to 30 million shares;

     -    eliminate the prohibition against stockholder action without a
          meeting;

     -    eliminate some anti-takeover and supermajority vote provisions;

     -    reduce the minimum number of directors of the Corporation from nine to
          seven;

     -    permit the bylaws to be made, repealed, altered, amended or rescinded
          by the vote of our stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding
          shares entitled to elect directors, rather than by stockholders
          holding 80% or more of the shares as currently required;

     -    decrease the stockholder vote necessary to approve an amendment to our
          Certificate of Incorporation that would contravene any bylaw, from the
          vote of stockholders holding 80% or more of our outstanding shares
          entitled to elect directors, to the vote of the holders of only a
          majority of the shares; and

     -    permit the Board of Directors to designate the date, time and place of
          all meetings of stockholders.

     We have discussed these changes in further detail below. Copies of our
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as now in effect and marked as proposed
to be amended are also included in Appendices A and B. The affirmative vote of
the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of ACCEL is required to
approve the proposed amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation and
amendments to the Bylaws. If stockholders approve the proposal, we intend to
file an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation shortly after the meeting.
The amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation will be effective immediately
when the Secretary of State of Delaware accepts the filing. The amendments to
the Bylaws will be effective when the stockholders approve it.

INCREASE IN NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES

     The proposed amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation will
increase the number of authorized shares of common stock of ACCEL from 15
million shares to 30 million shares. The additional shares of common stock to be
authorized will have rights identical to the currently outstanding shares of
common stock of ACCEL.

     The Board of Directors believes the proposed increase in the number of
authorized shares of common stock is necessary to provide ACCEL with the
flexibility to act in the future with respect to financing programs,
acquisitions, mergers, stock splits and other corporate purposes without the
delay and expense associated with obtaining stockholder approval each time an
opportunity requiring the issuance of shares may arise. After the proposed
amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation becomes effective, the Board
of Directors will be free to issue the additional authorized shares of common
stock without further action on the part of stockholders. Stockholders will not
have any preemptive rights to purchase the additional shares.

     The availability of authorized but unissued shares of common stock might be
deemed to have the effect of preventing or discouraging an attempt by another
person to obtain control of ACCEL, because the additional shares could be issued
by the Board of Directors, which could dilute the stock ownership of that
person. We have

                                                                         Page 16
<PAGE>   18
no plans for issuances for that purpose and this proposal is not being proposed
in response to a known effort to acquire control of ACCEL.

     The authorization of additional shares of common stock pursuant to this
proposal will itself have no dilutive effect upon the proportionate voting power
of the present stockholders of ACCEL. However, to the extent that ACCEL
subsequently issues shares to persons other than the present stockholders, the
issuance could have a substantial dilutive effect on present stockholders.

AMENDMENT PERMITTING ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

     Under the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, in
the absence of a prohibition against stockholder action without a meeting,
stockholders may take any action which may be taken at a meeting of stockholders
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if:

      -   the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
          number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the
          action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
          present and voted, sign consents in writing, setting forth the action;
          and

      -   deliver the consents to the corporation.

Consequently, the amendment will make it easier to gain stockholder approval at
any time approval is required without the delay and expense associated with
calling a special meeting of our stockholders. David T. Chase and related
persons currently have the power to vote a majority of the outstanding shares.
The amendment will give them the power, acting together, to take stockholder
action without a meeting. See "SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS"
on page 26.

AMENDMENT ELIMINATING ANTI-TAKEOVER AND SUPERMAJORITY PROVISIONS

     GENERAL DESCRIPTION. The proposed amended and restated Certificate of
Incorporation will result in the deletion, in their entirety, of Articles Sixth,
Tenth, Twelfth and Thirteenth of our existing Certificate of Incorporation and
the deletion of the second sentence of Article Fourteenth of our Certificate of
Incorporation. The proposed amendments to the Bylaws will amend Article IX.

     As noted above, the proposed amendment will eliminate Article Twelfth of
the existing Certificate of Incorporation in its entirety. Article Twelfth
requires that some transactions with a Related Corporation (as defined in
Article Twelfth) and the dissolution of ACCEL be approved by resolution of the
Board of Directors prior to the Related Corporation acquiring the beneficial
ownership of more than 5% of the outstanding common stock of ACCEL. If this
approval is not received, then the transaction must be approved by the holders
of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of ACCEL entitled to elect directors,
even if the approval of holders of only a simply majority of outstanding shares
or of the shares voted or represented at the meeting might otherwise be legally
required.

     It is important to understand that many of the terms defined in Article
Twelfth differ from similar concepts established under the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Article Twelfth defines a "Related Corporation" as any other
corporation or its affiliate if the other corporation and its affiliates singly
or in the aggregate are directly or indirectly the beneficial owners of more
than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation. The
transactions covered by Article Twelfth include:

         -  the merger of ACCEL with any Related Corporation;

         -  the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of
            ACCEL's assets or business to or with a Related Corporation; and

         -  the issuance or delivery by ACCEL of any stock or other securities
            in exchange or payment for any properties or assets of any Related
            Corporation or securities issued by any Related Corporation or in a
            merger of any affiliate of ACCEL with or into

                                    Page 17
<PAGE>   19
            any Related Corporation.

     The proposed amendment will also eliminate provisions in our existing
Certificate of Incorporation that require approval by holders of 80% or more of
the outstanding shares of ACCEL to amend, repeal or adopt:

          -    any provision of our Bylaws;

          -    an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation that would
               contravene any bylaw; and

          -    the following Articles of our Certificate of Incorporation:

               -    Article Thirteenth (governing some amendments to the
                    Certificate of Incorporation requiring an 80% supermajority
                    vote);

               -    Article Sixth (dealing with alteration of the bylaws by the
                    stockholders);

               -    Article Seventh (dealing with the number and selection of
                    directors);

               -    Article Tenth (dealing with the prohibition against
                    stockholder action without a meeting); and

               -    Article Twelfth (which is described above).

     The proposed amendment will also amend Article IX of our Bylaws, which
currently provides that the bylaws may be made, repealed, altered, amended or
rescinded by the Board of Directors or by the holders of not less than 80% of
the outstanding shares of ACCEL entitled to elect directors. Article IX also
provides that an 80% supermajority vote is required for any amendment to our
Certificate of Incorporation that would contravene any Bylaw in existence on the
record date of the applicable stockholder meeting. The proposed amendment will
change all of the foregoing 80% supermajority vote requirements to the vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ACCEL.

     If stockholders eliminate the supermajority vote requirements, then the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock could change our
Certificate of Incorporation, including changes to the size of the Board of
Directors beyond what is currently permitted by Article Seventh of the
Certificate of Incorporation. Also, the affirmative vote of a majority of either
the outstanding shares of common stock or the members of the Board of Directors
could change the bylaws.

     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND. Article Twelfth and the supermajority provisions are
intended to make it more difficult for a takeover to occur without the approval
of the Board of Directors. Our stockholders adopted Article Twelfth and the
supermajority voting provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and the
Bylaws that this proposal would eliminate at a time when unsolicited attempts to
take control of or acquire companies were common.

     REASONS FOR THE PROPOSAL.  The Board of Directors believes that the
provisions of Article Twelfth and the supermajority voting provisions contained
in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are no longer meaningful, but
have become unnecessary and potentially cumbersome. The Board of Directors
believes that elimination of Article Twelfth and the supermajority provisions
would provide greater flexibility in connection with the management of ACCEL and
transactions of the type subject to Article Twelfth and the 80% supermajority
voting provisions, and that this flexibility would be beneficial to ACCEL and
its stockholders.

     The Board of Directors believes that Article Twelfth is unnecessary because
we are subject to other safeguards that assure the fairness of transactions
involving interested directors or stockholders. For example, Section 144 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law requires that transactions with related parties
either be:

       -  approved by a majority of the disinterested directors, as


                                                                         Page 18
<PAGE>   20


          determined pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law;

       -  approved by the holders of a majority of the common stock
          entitled to vote thereon; or

       -  fair to ACCEL as of the time the Board of Directors or the holders of
          the common stock approved the transactions.

     In addition, it is our policy that any transaction with related parties be
on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained in an arms-length
transaction with unrelated parties. In approving any related party transaction,
decisions by members of the Board of Directors are subject to the fiduciary duty
requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law and related case law.

     Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, approval of mergers,
consolidations and similar extraordinary transactions that may be subject to
Article Twelfth generally would require the vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of ACCEL. Other transactions currently
covered by Article Twelfth may not require any stockholder vote under the
Delaware General Corporation Law. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, which became effective in 1987, restricts the ability
of stockholders who beneficially own 15% or more of the outstanding shares of a
corporation and have not held the shares for at least three years from engaging
in some business combination transactions involving the corporation.

     The Board of Directors believes that the supermajority voting provisions
are no longer meaningful or necessary due to our current ownership structure,
and may actually hinder our ability to raise capital or enter into business
combinations the Board of Directors believes are in our best interest.
Furthermore, the Board of Directors believes that the types of transactions
subject to Article Twelfth and the 80% supermajority voting provisions should
not be blocked by holders of a small minority of 20% of the common stock
outstanding.

     EFFECTS OF ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSAL. The elimination of Article Twelfth
would permit us and any Related Corporation to engage in transactions of the
type restricted by Article Twelfth with:

       -  approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock,
          pursuant to Sections 251 and 252 of the Delaware General Corporation
          Law; or

       -  in the case of some transactions with some Related Corporations, with
          the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors as
          determined in accordance with Section 144 of the Delaware General
          Corporation Law.

     Elimination of Article Twelfth would have the effect of rendering less
difficult the accomplishment of business combinations, changes in control of
ACCEL, unsolicited tender offers or mergers, and the assumption of control by
the holder of a large block of shares.

     The elimination of the 80% supermajority voting provisions would make it
easier for holders of a majority of the stock and current management to effect
changes to our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws which they favor, but
would make it more difficult for them to preclude changes they opposed or to
retain control if a hostile takeover was attempted.

     It is unlikely that a hostile takeover attempt, Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaw amendment or other stockholder initiative would be
successful unless supported by the Chase family. Members of the Chase family, in
conjunction with the senior management of ACCEL, if they vote together as a
block, presently are able to vote more than 50% of the common stock outstanding.
See "SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS" on page 26. The
elimination of Article Twelfth and the supermajority voting provisions would
make it easier for the Chase family along with the senior management of ACCEL to
obtain approval of a reorganization transaction with a Related Corporation,
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaw amendment or other extraordinary item that
they support, and also would make it more difficult for

                                                                         Page 19
<PAGE>   21
anyone else to block or veto a reorganization transaction with a Related
Corporation, Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaw amendment or other
extraordinary item that such person opposes.

AMENDMENT REDUCING MINIMUM NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

     The proposed amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation will reduce
the minimum number of directors to seven. The Certificate of Incorporation
presently requires at least nine directors.

     The Board of Directors believes that at times fewer than nine directors may
be appropriate for ACCEL. Also reducing the minimum will avoid potential
problems if nine qualified people are not willing to serve as directors.
Delaware law only requires that ACCEL have three directors. Although the Board
of Directors has no plans to reduce the present number of directors, it believes
that it is desirable to have the flexibility to have a smaller Board if that
becomes necessary or desirable in the future.

AMENDMENT TO PERMIT DIRECTORS TO ESTABLISH PLACE, DATE, AND TIME FOR
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

     The proposed amendment to the Bylaws will allow the Board of Directors to
designate the date, time and place for all meetings of stockholders.

     The current Bylaws state that all meetings of stockholders shall be held in
the State of Ohio, unless otherwise provided by a vote of the majority of the
directors. The Corporation's principal office is now in Connecticut and it is
unlikely that any meetings of stockholders will take place in the State of Ohio.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE
AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND THE BYLAWS AMENDMENTS.





                                                                         Page 20

      PROPOSAL NO. 3 - APPROVAL OF THE ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE
                        1996 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

GENERAL

          -    The Board of Directors has approved amendments (the "Plan
               Amendment") to the Corporation's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the
               "Plan") to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock,
               $.10 par value, of ACCEL ("Common Stock") with respect to which
               awards may be granted under the Plan. Currently, the maximum
               number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which awards may
               be granted under the Plan is 1,500,000. The Plan Amendment
               increases the maximum number of shares under the Plan to
               2,500,000, and Directors stock options from 500,000 to 750,000.

          -    In addition, the Board of Directors by unanimous vote may grant
               up to 150,000 stock options with an option price not less than
               $2.00 to an outside director who, in the opinion of the Board,
               performs services for the Corporation or its subsidiaries not
               contemplated by Director fees or other grants in the Plan. This
               action may only be taken independently by the Board excluding the
               Director receiving the special grant. Director stock options
               granted are provided at an option price of not less than $2.00.


     In order for the Plan amendment to become effective, stockholders must
approve it at the 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

THE PLAN

     The purpose of the Plan is to advance the long-term interests of the
Corporation by (i) motivating executive officers, other personnel and
independent agents of the Corporation by means of long-term incentive
compensation; (ii) furthering the identity of interests of participants with
those of the stockholders of the Corporation, through the ownership and
performance of the Common Stock; and (iii) permitting the Corporation to attract
and retain directors and executive personnel upon whose judgment the successful
conduct of the business of the Corporation largely depends.

SUMMARY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN

     Overview. The Plan permits the granting of (1) options to purchase shares
of Common Stock which are either (a) non-statutory stock options ("Non-statutory
Stock Options") not intended to qualify for special tax treatment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or (b) options which are
intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the Code ("Incentive Stock
Options"), (2) stock appreciation rights in conjunction with stock options, (3)
restricted stock awards, (4) phantom stock awards and (5) performance shares.
All employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries who hold a position with
responsibility in an executive, managerial, administrative or professional
capacity or independent agents who market and sell insurance written by a
subsidiary of the Corporation, and whose performance, as determined by the
Committee (as defined below under the caption "Administration") in the exercise
of the Committee's sole and absolute discretion, can have an effect on the
growth, profitability and success of the Corporation, are eligible to be
participants in the Plan. In addition, the Plan provides for the grant of stock
options to Directors of the Corporation who are not employees of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries (the "Outside Directors"). The Plan is not subject to
the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, and is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

     Common Stock Available. The total number of shares of Common Stock
currently available under the Plan is 1,500,000 shares. The proposed Plan
Amendment increases the maximum number of shares under the Plan to 2,500,000
shares. Of this maximum number, up to 750,000 shares may be issued pursuant to
the exercise of Outside Directors' stock options. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock deemed available for grant
in any fiscal year exceed 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock available for grant
to any individual participant in any

                                                                         Page 21
<PAGE>   23
calendar year shall not exceed 250,000. The number of shares of Common Stock
which remain available for grant pursuant to the Plan and Common Stock subject
to outstanding awards will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to
reflect changes in the Corporation's capitalization, including stock splits,
stock dividends, mergers, reorganizations, consolidations and recapitalizations.
The purchase price per share under outstanding options will also be
appropriately adjusted to reflect capitalization changes.

     Administration. The Plan may be administered by the Board of Directors or
such other committee designated by the Board to administer the Plan under
Section 3 of the Plan (the "Committee"). The Committee shall be composed of at
least three directors and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.
Each member of the Committee must be a director who is a "disinterested person"
under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and an "outside director" under Section
162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. The Committee has the
authority to select the employees and/or independent agents to be participants,
to determine the type and number of awards to be granted, and to establish rules
and regulations for the administration of the Plan.

     Stock Options. For stock options granted to employees or independent agents
under the Plan, the option price per share will be not less than 100% of the
fair market value of Common Stock on the date of the grant. Payment of the
option price upon exercise of an option may be made in cash, Common Stock, or a
combination thereof, as set forth in the option agreement. The term of each
option will be fixed by the Committee, except that Incentive Stock Options will
not be exercisable after 10 years from the grant date. The grant and terms of
Incentive Stock Options will be limited to the extent required by the Code.
Independent agents shall not be eligible to receive grants of Incentive Stock
Options. In the absence of any provision in an option to the contrary (i)
options will become exercisable as to 25% of the shares of Common Stock subject
to the option upon the completion of the first full year of employment or
retention and as to 25% of such shares upon the completion of each full year
thereafter prior to termination of the participant's relationship with the
Corporation, and (ii) options will lapse upon the earlier of (w) 180 days after
the termination of the participant's relationship with the Corporation if the
termination is due to death or disability or if the participant dies within 90
days of such termination, (x) 90 days after termination of the participant's
relationship with the Corporation for any other reason other than death,
disability or gross misconduct or neglect, (y) upon termination of the
participant's relationship with the Corporation if the termination is the result
of the participant's gross misconduct or neglect as determined by the Committee,
and (z) 10 years after the option was granted. Each stock option will be
evidenced by an option agreement conforming to the provisions of the Plan, in
such form as is approved by the Committee from time to time. The option
agreement will set forth the number of shares of Common Stock that are subject
to the option, the type of option granted, the option price to be paid upon
exercise, the manner in which the option is to be exercised, the option period,
and such other terms as may be approved by the Committee.

     Stock Appreciation Rights.  Stock appreciation rights may be granted
pursuant to the Plan either separately or in conjunction with other awards.
Stock appreciation rights related to stock options may be granted when the
option is granted, and with respect to non-statutory options, also may be
granted at any time before exercise or expiration of the option. Upon exercise
of a stock appreciation right, the holder will receive payment from the
Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of the then fair market value of
the Common Stock covered by the stock appreciation right over the option or
grant price of the stock appreciation right. The Committee may impose such
conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any stock appreciation right it
deems appropriate.

     Restricted Stock Awards. Restricted stock awards may be granted pursuant to
the Plan. Shares of Common Stock covered by restricted stock awards may not be
sold or otherwise transferred by the recipient until termination of the
restrictions applicable to the awards, which restrictions will be established by
the Committee and need not be the same for all such awards. Restricted stock
awards shall be subject to such terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations
as the Committee deems appropriate. During the period in which any shares of
Common Stock are

                                                                         Page 22
<PAGE>   24
subject to restrictions, the Committee may, in its discretion, grant to
recipients all or any of the rights of stockholders with respect to such Common
Stock.

     Phantom Stock Awards. Awards of phantom stock may be granted under the Plan
either separately or in conjunction with other awards. Phantom stock awards
entitle the recipient to receive the market value or appreciation in value of a
stated number of shares of Common Stock on a settlement date determined by the
Committee. The Committee has complete authority to determine the terms,
conditions, restrictions and limitations of such awards.

     Performance Shares. Performance shares may be granted under the Plan.
Performance shares are convertible into Common Stock or cash, or a combination
thereof, upon the obtainment of predetermined performance targets during an
established performance period. The Committee shall establish the performance
targets, the performance period and the other terms, conditions, restrictions or
limitations on any award of performance shares.

     Outside Director Stock Options.  The Plan provides for the grant to Outside
Directors of options to purchase Common Stock ("Outside Director Stock
Options"). See "Compensation of Directors". Each Outside Director who is elected
or appointed to serve as a Director of the Corporation after the effective date
of the Plan and who is not a Director on the effective date of the Plan, shall,
upon his initial appointment or election, automatically be granted an option to
purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock.

At each year's annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation there shall
be granted automatically to each Outside Director (other than any Outside
Director who first became a Director at any time during the period following the
immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders), the option to purchase
10,000 shares of Common Stock. All Outside Director Stock Options will be
Non-statutory Stock Options with a 10-year term , and the purchase price per
share will be 100% of the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of
grant. Payment of the Option price may be made in cash, Common Stock, or a
combination thereof, as set forth in the option agreement. In the absence of any
provision in an option to the contrary, options will become exercisable as to
50% of the shares of Common Stock subject to the option upon the completion of
each full year thereafter prior to termination. Outside Director Stock Options
not otherwise exercisable at the time of the termination of the Director's
status as a Director may be exercised for 180 days following the date of such
termination, as long as such period is within the original 10-year option term.
Outside Director Options not otherwise exercisable at the time of the death or
voluntary retirement of a Director may be exercised for a period of 180 days
subject to the original term of the option.

     Tax Effects. For federal income tax purposes, under existing statutes,
regulations and authorities, an optionee does not realize taxable income at the
time of the grant of an Incentive Stock Option, a Non-statutory Stock Option,
phantom stock award or a stock appreciation right. Upon the exercise of a
Non-statutory Stock Option, the Corporation is entitled to a compensation
expense deduction in the amount by which the fair market value of the subject
Common Stock exceeds the option price and the optionee realizes ordinary income
in such amount. Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the Corporation
is entitled to a deduction and the optionee realizes ordinary income in the
amount of the cash or fair market value of the Common Stock received. On the
subsequent sale of Common Stock received upon the exercise of a Non-statutory
Stock Option, the difference between the fair market value of the Common Stock
on the date of receipt and the amount realized on the sale will be treated as
capital gain or loss, which will be short or long term depending on the period
for which the Common Stock is held prior to the sale. An optionee will have no
taxable income upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option (except that the
alternative minimum tax may apply) and generally does not realize taxable income
until the sale of the Common Stock received upon exercise of the option. If a
sale does not take place until at least two years after grant and one year after
exercise of the option, any gain or loss realized will be treated as long term
capital gain or loss. Under such circumstances, the Corporation will not be
entitled to a deduction in connection with the grant or the exercise of the
option. If a disposition occurs prior to two years after grant or one year after
exercise, then the difference between the option price and the fair market value
of the Common Stock on the date of exercise (or in

                                                                         Page 23
<PAGE>   25
certain cases, the amount realized on sale, if less than the market value on the
date of exercise) is taxable as ordinary income to the optionee and is
deductible by the Corporation for federal income tax purposes.

     With respect to awards of phantom stock, a participant will realize
ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock or
appreciation in value of the Common Stock, as applicable, on the settlement date
and the Corporation will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount. With
respect to restricted stock awards, a participant generally will realize
ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock received as
of the first day that such shares of Common Stock become transferable or are not
subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier. The
Corporation will be entitled to a deduction at that time in the same amount.

     Assignment of Interest. Except as expressly provided in the Plan with
respect to transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution, no option,
phantom stock awards, stock appreciation right or restricted stock award may be
assigned or transferred by any participant.

     Limitations on Resale of Securities. Participants who are officers or
directors of the Corporation, including those who may be deemed "affiliates" of
the Corporation, as such term is defined under the Securities Act, have certain
limitations on their ability to resell Common Stock acquired pursuant to the
Plan. Any sale of Common Stock by an employee or Outside Director also must be
made in compliance with the Corporation's policies on trading in securities of
the Corporation.

     Amendment or Termination of the Plan. No awards may be granted under the
Plan after June 11, 2006. The Plan gives the Committee the power to suspend,
reinstate and terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time. In
addition, the Committee may amend the Plan, except that, without any required
stockholder approval, no such amendment may (1) materially increase the benefits
to participants in the Plan, (2) materially increase the total number of shares
of Common Stock that could be issued or (3) materially modify the requirements
as to eligibility for participation in the Plan. The provisions of the Plan
relating to the eligibility for, and the amount, price and timing of, awards to
Outside Directors may not be amended, nor shall the operation of such provisions
be suspended or reinstated, more than once every six months.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE PLAN

SECTION 5: SHARES AVAILABLE

     The Board of Directors has approved, subject to the approval of the
stockholders, amendments to the Plan which would increase the total number of
shares of Common Stock with respect to which awards may be granted from
1,500,000 to 2,500,000, and Directors stock options from 500,000 to 750,000. The
Board believes that the Plan is an important way to attract, retain and motivate
key employees, and that it is appropriate to increase the number of shares
available for awards under the Plan. Approval of the proposed Plan Amendments
will ensure that enough shares are available under the Plan to encourage stock
ownership by executive officers and key employees and to help the Corporation
attract and retain individuals who will contribute to the Corporation's success.

SECTION 13: DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTIONS.

     In addition, the Board of Directors by unanimous vote may grant up to
150,000 stock options with an option price not less than $2.00 to an outside
director who, in the opinion of the Board, performs services for the Corporation
or its subsidiaries not contemplated by Director fees or other grants in the
Plan. This action may only be taken independently by the Board excluding the
Director receiving the special grant. Director stock options granted are
provided at an option price of not less than $2.00.


                                                                         Page 24
<PAGE>   26
     No other changes to the Plan are proposed. The text of the proposed
amendment to the Plan is included in this Proxy Statement as Appendix C.

     Approval of the proposed amendments to the Plan requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares voting in person or by proxy at
the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE
AMENDMENTS TO THE 1996 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN.

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     During 1999 the Board of Directors acted on executive compensation. Mr.
Coats' compensation, which had been increased to $200,000 when he became
President and CEO on October 1, 1998, was continued on that level while he was
in charge of restructuring the Corporation. All employees were terminated as of
December 31, 1999, and the Corporation office was moved to Simsbury, Connecticut
into the quarters of Allegiance Insurance Managers. Gerald H. Pastor, President
of Allegiance, was appointed President of Acceleration National Insurance
Company on October 5, 1999 in anticipation of the move and was then appointed
President and CEO of ACCEL on November 16, 1999. His salary was established at
$250,000.

             SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires our
officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of the common stock,
to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are
required by Securities and Exchange Commission regulations to furnish us with
copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

     Based solely on our review of the copies of the forms received by us or
written representations from some reporting persons that no Forms 5 were
required of them, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater
than 10% stockholders were complied with.

                      RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     KPMG, LLP has served as our independent auditor for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1999. In recent years, it has been the
practice of the Board of Directors to annually review and select independent
auditors of ACCEL. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected to
retain for the current fiscal year KPMG, LLP as the independent auditors for the
corporation. Representatives of KPMG, LLP will be present at the meeting, will
have an opportunity to make a statement, if desired, and will be available to
respond to appropriate questions, if any, of our stockholders.

                              STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Stockholders wishing to submit proposals to our 2001 proxy statement may do
so prior to April 4, 2001 by letter addressed to us in care of our Corporate
Secretary.

     On May 21, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted an
amendment to Rule 14a-4, as promulgated under the Exchange Act. The amendment to
14a-4 (c)(1) governs our use of discretionary proxy voting authority with
respect to a stockholder proposal which the stockholder has not sought to
include in our proxy statement. The new amendment provides that if a proponent
of a proposal fails to notify us at least 45 days prior to the month and day of
mailing of the prior year's proxy statement, then the management proxies will be
allowed to use their discretionary voting authority when the proposal is raised
at that meeting, without any discussion of the matter in the proxy statement.

     With respect to our 2001 meeting of stockholders, if we are not provided
notice of a stockholder proposal that the stockholder has not previously sought
to include in our proxy statement by April 4, 2001, the management proxies will
be allowed to use their discretionary authority as outlined above.

                                  OTHER MATTERS

     As of the date of this proxy statement, we do not expect any matters other
than these described in this proxy statement will be brought before the meeting.
If any other business properly comes before the meeting, or any adjournment of
the meeting, the proxy holders will vote in regard to the other business
according to their discretion insofar as the proxies are not limited to the
contrary.
