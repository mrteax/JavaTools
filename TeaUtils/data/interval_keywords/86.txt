Associates, Inc. ("Price Associates") serves as investment advisor with power
to direct investments and/or sole power to vote the securities.  For purposes
of the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Price
Associates is deemed sole owner of such securities; however, Price Associates
expressly disclaims that it is, in fact, the beneficial owner of such
securities.

<PAGE>
PROPOSAL 2: APPROVE AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO 20 MILLION.

We propose to amend paragraph THIRD (a) of the Certificate of Incorporation to
increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 10 million to 20
million.

- - - Of the 10 million shares presently authorized for issuance under our
Certificate of Incorporation, there are only approximately 100,000 shares
unissued and unreserved. As of the record date, there were approximately 9
million shares issued and approximately 900,000 reserved for issuance.

- - - Our proposed amendment increases the number of authorized shares of common
stock by 10 million. The additional shares, if issued, would have the same
rights as the shares of common stock now outstanding.  The Board has no present
plans, agreements, commitments or understandings for the issuance or use of
these proposed additional shares.

- - - We believe that the proposed increase is in the best interests of Aceto and
our stockholders. It is important for the Board to have the flexibility to act
promptly to meet future business needs as they arise. Sufficient shares should
be readily available to maintain our financing and capital raising flexibility,
for stock splits and stock dividends, acquisitions and mergers, employee
benefit plans and other proper business purposes.

- - - By having additional shares readily available for issuance, the Board will be
able to act expeditiously without spending the time and incurring the expense
of soliciting proxies and holding special meetings of stockholders. For
example, today, if the Board determined that a stock split were advisable to
enhance your liquidity or to achieve a more attractive market price for a
broader spectrum of investors, the Board would not have sufficient authorized
shares available to effect a split.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding votes is required to
approve the amendment.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO 20
MILLION.

PROPOSAL 3: APPROVE THE ACETO CORPORATION 1998 OMNIBUS EQUITY AWARD PLAN

We are asking for your approval of the 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan ("The
Plan").  The Board adopted The Plan on September 8, 1998, subject to your
approval at the Annual Meeting.

We have summarized below certain key provisions of The Plan.  Because it is a
summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you.
Before you decide how to vote, you should review the full text of The Plan,
which we have included as Exhibit B.



                   DESCRIPTION OF OMNIBUS EQUITY AWARD PLAN

PURPOSES AND ELIGIBILITY
The purposes of the Omnibus Equity Award Plan are to attract, retain and
motivate eligible participants, to compensate them for their contributions to
our growth and profits and to encourage them to own Aceto common stock. The
Omnibus Equity Award Plan authorizes the issuance of certain awards to such
individuals. We estimate that as of September 11, 1998, approximately 80
individuals were eligible to participate in the Omnibus Equity Award Plan.
Eligible participants will be employees (including officers and directors of
the Company or its affiliates), non-employee directors, advisors, consultants
or independent contractors to the Company or its affiliates.

SHARES AVAILABLE, OVERALL LIMIT
A total of 500,000 shares of common stock will be authorized for issuance under
The Plan.  We will adjust the number of shares available for issuance under The
Plan if there are changes in our capitalization, including (but not limited to)
stock dividends, stock splits, a merger, reorganization or similar
transactions.  We may issue new shares or treasury shares or both.  Treasury
shares are shares that we previously issued and subsequently repurchased and
are holding in our treasury.

ADMINISTRATION
The Plan will be administered by the Board.  The Executive Committee of the
Board ("Committee") will make recommendations to the Board as to which
participants from among the eligible participants shall receive awards and
determine the form, terms and conditions of awards. The Board will make all
awards under The Plan, and shall have sole discretion with regard to any award.

AWARDS GENERALLY
The Plan authorizes the following awards based upon Aceto common stock: stock
options, restricted stock, or other stock-based awards the Committee determines
to be consistent with the purposes of The Plan and the interests of Aceto.  The
Board will determine vesting, exercisability, payment and other restrictions
that apply to an award.  Vesting means the individual has the right to the
award.

CHANGE IN CONTROL
A change in control of Aceto (generally a merger or consolidation into another
company or a "person" becoming beneficial owner of 20% or more of Aceto's
voting stock without concurrence of the Board) will cause all outstanding
awards to vest, become immediately exercisable, and have all restrictions
lifted.  (The change in control provision could be viewed as having a possible
anti-takeover consequence, in that it could have a deterrent effect against a
hostile takeover).

STOCK OPTIONS
All stock options issued will be non-qualified.  The exercise price per share
shall be not less than the fair market value of Aceto common stock on the date
of grant.  The exercise price of a stock option may be paid in cash or
previously owned stock or both.

The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee, will fix the term of a stock
option upon grant. However, under The Plan, the term may not be longer than ten
years from the date of award.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
Restricted Stock awards may be awarded to an eligible participant in lieu of a
portion of cash bonus earned by the participant. These restricted shares will
vest over a period of years as determined by the Board at time of grant and
will not be transferable until vested.  In addition, awards of Restricted Stock
may have a premium paid in additional shares when fully vested.  There may be
other restrictions as the Board may determine.

OTHER OMNIBUS EQUITY AWARDS
The Board upon recommendation of the Committee has the authority to specify the
terms and provisions of other forms of equity-based awards or equity-related
awards not described above which the Committee determines to be consistent with
the purposes of the Omnibus Equity Award Plan and the interests of Aceto.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
One of the objectives of The Plan is that certain designated employees be
stockholders.  The Plan contains guidelines for stock ownership, to be attained
in five years, relative to the positions and base salaries of the employees
involved.  Restricted Stock awards can be used to satisfy these requirements.

TERMINATION
No awards shall be made after ten years from the date of approval by the
stockholders.

AMENDMENT
We may amend or terminate the Plan at any time. However, we must obtain
stockholder approval to:

     - increase the maximum number of shares issuable, or
     - reduce the exercise price of a stock option.

Also, we may not amend or terminate The Plan without an employee's consent if
it would adversely affect an employee's rights to previously-granted awards.

STOCK PRICE
On September 4, 1998, the closing price of Aceto common stock on NASDAQ was
$13.13.

NEW PLAN BENEFITS
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we have made awards under The Plan,
totaling 20,000 shares of Restricted Stock, subject to approval of The Plan at
this Annual Meeting.  Since awards will be authorized by the Board in its sole
discretion, it is not possible to determine the benefits or amounts that will
be received by any particular employee or group of employees in the future.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
The federal income tax consequences of issuing and exercising non-qualified
stock options under the Plan may be summarized as follows:

The grant of a non-qualified stock option has no immediate federal income tax
effect: the employee will not recognize taxable income and Aceto will not
receive a tax deduction.

When the employee exercises the option, the employee will recognize ordinary
income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price. Aceto is required to
withhold tax on the amount of income recognized. Aceto will receive a tax
deduction equal to the amount of income recognized.

When the employee sells common stock obtained from exercising a non-qualified
stock option, any gain or loss will be taxed as a capital gain or loss (long-
term or short-term, depending on how long the shares have been held). Certain
additional rules apply if the exercise price for an option is paid in shares
previously owned by the employee.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting is
required to approve The Plan.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE ACETO CORPORATION
1998 EQUITY AWARD PLAN.

On June 9, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors adopted resolutions amending
the Company's 1980 Stock Option Plan ("the Option Plan"), in the following
respects: the Plan is to be administered by a committee consisting of not less
than three directors, all of whom shall be "disinterested persons"; a committee
member shall be a "disinterested person" only if such person is not, at the
time he exercises discretion in administering the Option Plan, eligible, and
has not at any time within one year prior thereto been eligible, for selection
as a person as to whom options may be granted; and no option may be granted to
any director as to whom the proxy statement for the meeting of stockholders at
which the Option Plan was submitted for approval of the stockholders of the
Company disclosed that such director will not participate in the Option Plan.

On December 4, 1997, a committee consisting of Samuel I. Hendler (Chairman),
Stephen M. Goldstein and Robert A. Wiesen was appointed by the Board of
Directors to administer the Option Plan. All of said directors were
disinterested persons as defined by the Option Plan.



REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are Leonard S.
Schwartz (Chairman), Stephen M. Goldstein, Samuel I. Hendler and Robert A.
Wiesen, functions as the Executive Compensation Committee, and makes
recommendations to the Board with respect to the remuneration of the Company's
executive officers.

The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the Company to
attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and abilities will
contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum profitability to
the Company and its stockholders, by providing salaries and benefits
competitive with those offered by other companies in the chemical industry.
The executive compensation program includes base salary, annual incentive
compensation (cash bonuses), and long term incentive compensation (stock
options).

Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the chemical industry.
Because of the way that the Company operates its business, the contributions of
its executives significantly affect corporate profitability.  Bonuses (which
can exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such contributions.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) also is the President and Chief Operating
Officer (COO) of the Company.  The bonuses paid to the CEO and to the
Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), reflect the
Company's overall performance (excluding extraordinary events such as a plant
shut-down).

The three highest paid executives, other than the CEO and CFO, are each
responsible for the performance of one of the Company's principal profit
centers.  Internally generated performance records are kept on a monthly and
yearly basis for these profit centers, and each center's profitability is
compared in the current year to the previous year.  Other factors considered in
determining the bonuses of individual executives are the individual's own
performance and the overall performance of the Company.  The Executive
Compensation Committee determines each bonus primarily based on this data, also
taking into account the long term contributions of each individual.


CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION

The CEO's compensation was determined not only on the basis of the same factors
utilized to compensate other executives, but also on the basis of the
additional duties and responsibilities assumed by him.  Mr. Schwartz had been
an executive of the Company responsible for the performance of one of its
principal profit centers prior to his becoming President and COO on July 1,
1996.  In addition to serving in such capacities, as of July 1, 1997, he was
appointed Chairman of the Board and CEO.  Messrs. Hendler, Goldstein and Wiesen
took into account total compensation comparisons of top executives of
corporations considered to be in the Company's peer group, as well as the
overall performance of the Company and the increase in corporate stature and
stockholder value since Mr. Schwartz assumed the positions of Chairman and CEO.
(Mr. Schwartz removed himself from participation in the decision of the
Executive Compensation Committee regarding his compensation, although he did
express to the Committee his requests and views in the matter).

            Leonard S. Schwartz, Chairman
            Stephen M. Goldstein
            Samuel I. Hendler
            Robert A. Wiesen

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Each non-employee director receives $10,000 per year for serving on the Board
of Directors plus $500 for each committee meeting attended. There is no
additional compensation for directors who are also employees.

Non-employee directors currently are not eligible to receive stock options.
However, if the Aceto Corporation 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan is approved,
they will be eligible to receive stock options and other awards under the plan.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

There are no employment contracts with any director, nominee for election as
director, or officer; however, Messrs. Amitrano, Baldi, Brunner and Schwartz
have signed patent and trade secret agreements.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

Samuel I. Hendler, a director of the Company, serves as general counsel to the
Company. Robert A. Wiesen, a director of the Company, is a partner in the law
firm of Clifton Budd & DeMaria, which serves as labor and employment law
counsel of the Company.

Arnold J. Frankel, a director of the Company, retired from his position as
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer effective June 30, 1997. The
Board of Directors authorized his being retained as a consultant for a period
of eighteen months, to December 31, 1998. He will be paid $64,200 for
consulting services during the current fiscal year.

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's
directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of the
registered class of the Company's equity securities to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), initial reports of ownership and reports
of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the
Company. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by
SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file. To the Company's knowledge, based solely on review of the copies of
such reports furnished to the Company and representations that no other reports
were required during the fiscal year, all Section 16(a) filing requirements
applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners
were complied with.

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board has again appointed the firm of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP as independent
auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999.  A representative of KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to
respond to appropriate questions from stockholders and will have the
opportunity to make a statement, if he so desires.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Any proposal which a stockholder intends to present at the 1999 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders must be duly received by the Company on or before June 11,
1999.

OTHER MATTERS

The Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended June 30, 1998 is
being mailed to stockholders with this Proxy Statement.

The cost of solicitation of proxies in the accompanying form will be borne by
the Company, including expenses in connection with preparing and mailing this
Proxy Statement. In addition to the use of mails, proxies may be solicited by
personal interview, facsimile, telephone or telegram by directors, officers and
employees of the Company. Arrangements may also be made with brokerage houses
and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of
solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such
persons, and the Company may reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection therewith.

The management does not know of any matters to be presented for consideration,
other than the matters described in the Notice of Annual Meeting, but if other
matters are presented, it is the intention of the persons named in the
accompanying proxy to vote on such matters in accordance with their judgment.

The Company will provide, without charge to each person whose proxy is
solicited, on the written request of any such person, a copy of the Company's
annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1998 required to
be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the financial
statements and the schedules thereto. Such written request should be directed
to Mr. Donald Horowitz, Aceto Corporation, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New
York 11042-1215. Each such request must set forth a good faith representation
that, as of September 11, 1998 the person making the request was a beneficial
owner of securities entitled to vote at the annual meeting of stockholders.

designation of Participants; (ii) the type or types of Awards to be granted to
an Eligible Participant; (iii) the number of Shares to be covered by Awards;
(iv) terms and conditions of Awards; and (v) unless otherwise expressly
provided in the Plan, designations, determination, interpretations, and
suggested decisions with respect to the Plan or any Award.

(b) AUTHORITY OF BOARD.  All Awards under the Plan shall be made by the Board,
which shall have full authority to accept, reject or modify  any
recommendations of the Committee.  All designations, determinations,
interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to the Plan or any
Award shall be within the sole discretion of the Board, may be made at any time
and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all Persons, including the
Company, any Affiliate, any Participant, any holder or beneficiary of any
Award, and any stockholder.

SECTION 4.
Shares Available for Awards.

(a) SHARES AVAILABLE. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(b), the
number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan
shall be five hundred thousand (500,000).

If, after the effective date of the Plan, any Shares covered by an Award
granted under the Plan are forfeited, or if such an Award terminates or is
canceled without the delivery of shares, then the Shares covered by such Award,
or the  number of Shares otherwise counted against the aggregate  number of
Shares  with respect to which Awards may be granted, to the extent of  any
such,  forfeiture,  termination or  cancellation, shall again become Shares
with respect  to  which  Awards  may  be granted.   In the event that any
Option or other Award granted hereunder is exercised through the delivery of
Shares or in the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from such Award
are satisfied by the withholding of Shares by the Company, the number of Shares
available for Awards under the Plan shall be increased by the number of Shares
so surrendered or withheld.

(b) ADJUSTMENTS.  In the event that  any dividend (other than regular
dividends) or other distribution (whether in the form of  cash, Shares, other
securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
repurchase, or exchange of Shares, or other similar corporate transaction or
event affects the Shares such  that an adjustment is appropriate in order to
prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended
to be made available under the Plan, then adjustment shall be made, in such
manner as shall be equitable, of (i) the number of Shares with respect to which
Awards may be granted, (ii) the number of Shares subject to outstanding Awards,
and (iii) the grant or exercise price with respect to any Award, provided, that
with respect to any Award no such adjustment shall be made to the extent that
such adjustment  would be inconsistent with the Plan's meeting the requirements
of Section 162(m) of the Code, as from time to time amended.

(c)   SOURCES OF SHARES DELIVERABLE UNDER AWARDS.  Any Shares delivered
pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and
unissued Shares or of treasury Shares.

SECTION 5.
Eligibility.

Any employee (including an officer, Executive Officer or director) of the
Company or any Affiliate, including any non-employee director, advisor,
consultant or independent contractor to the Company or any Affiliate, shall be
an Eligible Participant.  To the extent the Board deems it necessary,
appropriate or desirable to comply with foreign law or practice and to further
the purpose of this Plan, the Board may, without amending this Plan, (i)
establish rules applicable to Awards granted to Participants who are foreign
nationals, are employed outside the United States, or both, including rules
that differ from those set forth in this Plan, and (ii) grant Awards to such
Participants in accordance with those rules.

SECTION 6.
Stock Options.  - TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

All Options granted under the Plan shall be Non-qualified Stock Options and
shall be evidenced by Award Agreements which shall be subject to applicable
provisions of the Plan and such other provisions as they may contain including:

(a)   PRICE. The exercise price per Share shall not be less than 100% of the
Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of Award.

(b)   PERIOD.  The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee may establish
the term of any Option award under the Plan, provided, however, that an Option
shall expire no later than 10 years from the date of Award.

(c)   TIME OF EXERCISE.  The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee, may
establish installment exercise terms in Awards to Participants based on the
Company's publicly traded Share price, and may establish installment exercise
terms based on the passage of time or  otherwise,  such  that the Option
becomes fully exercisable in a series of cumulating portions, and may also
establish   other  conditions of exercise as it shall determine and may
accelerate  the  exercisability  of  any  Option  granted to a Participant
under the Plan.

(d)   PAYMENT.    No  Shares  shall  be delivered  pursuant to  any  exercise
of an Option  until  payment  in full of the option price in cash, or its
equivalent, or by exchanging  Shares  owned by the optionee (which are not the
subject of any pledge or other  security  interest),  or  by  a combination of
the foregoing, provided that the combined value of all cash and cash
equivalents and the Fair Market Value of any such Shares so tendered to the
Company as of the date of such tender is at least equal to such option price.

(e)   EXERCISE. An Option, or portion thereof, shall be exercised by delivery
of a written notice of exercise to the Company, and payment of the full price
of the Shares being exercised.  A Participant shall not have any of the rights
or privileges of the holder of Common Stock until such time as Shares of Common
Stock are issued or transferred to the Participant.

SECTION 7.
Restricted Stock

(a)   GRANT. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board, upon
recommendation of the Committee, shall have authority to determine the
Participants to whom Shares of Restricted Stock shall be granted, the number of
Shares of Restricted Stock to be granted to each Participant, and the other
terms and conditions of such Awards.  Restricted Stock may be awarded to an
Eligible Participant in lieu of a portion, as determined by the Board, of any
annual cash bonus earned by such Participant, which will vest ratably over a
period of years determined by the Board on each anniversary of the date of
Award.  Such Restricted Stock so awarded, as set forth in the Award Agreement
may have a premium in Shares greater than the portion of the bonus to be  paid
in Restricted Shares, which Premium shares shall be delivered to the
Participant when the Award is fully vested, provided that the Participant is in
the employ of the Company when vesting occurs.

(b)   TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS.  Upon the lapse of the restrictions applicable to
Shares of Restricted Stock, the Company shall deliver certificates for same to
the Participant or the Participant's legal representative.

(c)   PAYMENT.  Each share of Restricted Stock  shall be paid in Shares, upon
the lapse of the restrictions applicable thereto, or otherwise in accordance
with the applicable Award Agreement.

(d)   DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Dividends and other distributions paid on
or in respect of any Shares of Restricted Stock shall be paid to the
Participant.

SECTION 8.
Termination of Employment.

The following provisions shall apply in the event of the Participant's
termination of employment unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement:

(a)   NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS.
      (i)  Termination of Employment.  If the Participant's employment with the
Company or its Affiliates is terminated for any reason other than death,
permanent and total disability, or retirement, the Participant's right to
exercise any Non-Qualified Stock Option shall terminate, and such Option shall
expire, on the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of such termination of
employment or (B) the date of such Option would have expired had it not been
for the termination of employment.  The Participant shall have the right to
exercise such option prior to such expiration to the extent it was exercisable
at the date of such termination of employment and shall not have been
exercised.

      (ii)  Death,  Disability or Retirement. If  the  Participant's
employment  with  the  Company or its Affiliates is terminated by death,
permanent  and total disability, or retirement, the   Participant or his or her
estate representative (if employment is terminated by death) shall have the
right, within  three (3) months from the date of determination  of  permanent
and  total disability,  retirement, or the appointment of an estate
representative, to  exercise  any  Non-Qualified  Stock  Option  to  the
extent  it was   exercisable  at   the  date of   such   termination   of
employment   and shall not have   been   exercised,   but  in no event shall
such option be exercisable later than the date the Option would have expired
had it not been for the termination of such employment.

(b) RESTRICTED STOCK.    In the event of a Participant's retirement, permanent
and total disability, or death, or in cases of special circumstances, the Board
may, when it finds that  a waiver would be in the best interest of the Company,
waive  in whole or in part, any  or  all remaining restrictions with respect to
such Participant's entitlement to shares of Restricted Stock.

SECTION 9.
Change in Control.

Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of the Plan to the contrary, upon a
Change in Control all outstanding Awards shall vest, become immediately
exercisable or payable and have all restrictions lifted as may apply to the
type of Award.

SECTION 10.
Amendment and Termination.

(a)   AMENDMENTS TO THE PLAN.  The Board may amend, alter, suspend,
discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided
that no such amendment, alteration, suspension discontinuation or termination
shall be made without stockholder approval to: increase the number of shares
issuable; reduce the exercise price of Options; or extend the termination
period of the Plan. The Board, however,  may not amend or terminate the Plan
without a Participant's consent insofar as it would adversely affect a
Participant's rights to previously granted Awards.

(b)   CANCELLATION.  Any Award granted hereunder may be canceled with the
approval and agreement of the Participant in consideration of a cash payment or
alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to
the Fair Market Value of such canceled Award.

SECTION 11.
General Provisions

(a)   NONTRANSFERABILITY. No Award shall be assigned, alienated, pledged,
attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant, except
by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a QDRO.

(b)   NO RIGHTS TO AWARDS.  No Participant or other Person shall have any claim
to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment
of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.  The terms and
conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.

(c)   SHARE CERTIFICATES.  All certificates for Shares or other securities  of
the Company delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise
thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as
the Board may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and
other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock
exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any
applicable Federal or state laws, and a legend or legends may be put on any
such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

(d)   WITHHOLDING. A Participant may be required to pay to the Company and the
Company shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold from any
Award, from any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan
or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in
cash, or Shares), of any applicable withholding taxes in respect of an Award,
its exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the Plan and
to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to
satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.

(e)   AWARD AGREEMENTS.  Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an Award
Agreement that shall be delivered to the Participant and shall specify the
terms and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable thereto.

(f)   NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT.  The grant of an Award shall not be construed as
giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or
any Affiliate.  Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a
Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the
Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award
Agreement.

(g)   RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER.  No holder of an Award of stock options or
beneficiary of any such Award shall have any rights as a stockholder with
respect to such options until he or she has exercised such option and become
the holder of Shares.  In connection with each grant of Restricted Stock
hereunder, the applicable Award shall be entitled to the rights of a
stockholder in respect of such Restricted Stock, except for such transfer
restrictions as may be applicable thereto.

(h)   GOVERNING LAW. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any
rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be
determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

(i)   SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or
is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to
any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any
applicable law, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform
to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without,
in the determination of the Board, materially altering the intent of the Plan
or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person
or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full
force and effect.

(j)   OTHER LAWS. The Company may refuse to issue or transfer  any Shares or
other consideration under an Award if, it determines that the issuance or
transfer of such shares might violate any applicable law or regulation or
entitle the Company to recover the same under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, and any payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or
beneficiary in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly
refunded to the relevant Participant, holder, or beneficiary.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no Award granted hereunder shall be construed
as an offer to sell securities of the Company, and no such offer shall be
outstanding, unless the Board has determined that any such offer, if made,
would be in compliance with all applicable requirements of the U.S. federal
securities laws any other laws to which such offer, if made, would be subject.

(k)   NO TRUST FUND CREATED.  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be
construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person.  To the
extent that any Person acquires rights pursuant to an Award, such rights shall
be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

(l)   NO OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE OPTIONS.  The granting of an Option shall
impose no obligation upon the Participant to exercise such Option.

(m)   PLAN EXPENSES.  Any expenses of administering this Plan shall be borne by
the Company.

(n)   NO WARRANTY OF TAX EFFECT.  Except as may be contained in any Award
Agreement, no opinion shall be deemed to be expressed or warranties made as to
the effect of  foreign, federal, state, or local tax on any Awards.

SECTION 12.
Share Ownership Guidelines.

It is an objective of this Plan that designated Eligible Participants be owners
of Shares.

(a)   APPLICABILITY. Share ownership guidelines are applicable to the Chief
Executive Officer ("CEO") and to managerial Participants designated by the
Board ("Designated Participants").

(b)   BASIS.  Share ownership guidelines are in terms of Fair Market Value of
Shares to be owned relative to the positions held and base salaries of
Designated Participants.  Ownership levels and guidelines will be reviewed (and
if advisable modified) by the Board (upon recommendation of the Committee)
periodically, based on internal reports and overall operations of the Company.

(c)   TARGETED GUIDELINE LEVELS.  Designated Participants will either from
inception of the Plan or commencement of employment have five (5) years to
reach the targeted guideline levels of Share ownership, which levels can be
changed, modified, or suspended due to individual or group circumstances.
Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant shall be included in calculating
Shares owned.

(d)   GUIDELINES.

            POSITION/BASE SALARY GUIDELINES, AS A MULTIPLE
