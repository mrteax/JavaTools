PROXY STATEMENT

ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
October 12, 1994

SOLICITATION

This Proxy Statement is being furnished to stockholders of AAR CORP., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company" or "AAR"), in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company for use at the Annual Meeting
of Stockholders of the Company to be held in the Shareholders Room (21st Floor)
of Continental Bank N.A., 231 S. LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois, on
Wednesday, October 12, 1994, at 3:00 P.M. (Chicago time), or any adjournment
thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement is first being sent to
stockholders on or about August 30, 1994.

Any proxy solicited herewith may be revoked by a stockholder at any time prior
to the voting thereof by sending written notice of revocation to the Secretary
of the Company, or by delivering a later-dated proxy, or by attending the Annual
Meeting and voting in person. Shares of Common Stock represented by proxies that
are properly executed and returned to the Company will be voted as specified
thereon at the Annual Meeting. If no choice is specified, such shares will be
voted FOR the election of the three nominees for director designated by the
Board of Directors, and upon any other matters that may properly come before the
Annual Meeting in the discretion of the named proxies. In the event any nominee
is unavailable for election, which is not presently anticipated, shares
represented by valid proxies will be voted for such other person or persons as
the named proxies shall determine in their discretion.

As provided in the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan, shares held by the Dividend Reinvestment Agent for a participant will be
voted in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card received
representing such shares or otherwise as set forth above.

The cost of the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company and will
consist primarily of printing, postage and handling, including reimbursement to
banks, brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy material to their respective
principals. The Company has engaged D. F. King & Co., 77 Water Street, New York,
New York, to aid in the solicitation of proxies at a total estimated cost of
$7,000.00. D. F. King & Co. may solicit proxies by mail, personally, or by
telephone or telegraph. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by D. F. King
& Co. and by use of the mails, certain officers, directors and employees of the
Company may solicit proxies personally, or by telephone or telegraph, without
additional compensation.

QUORUM AND VOTING RIGHTS

At the close of business on August 15, 1994, the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, there were
outstanding 15,906,792 shares of common stock of the Company, $1.00 par value
("Common Stock"). Each stockholder of record is entitled to one vote for every
share held on the record date. Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting
unless the

                                       1
<PAGE>
owner thereof is present in person or by proxy. A quorum of stockholders is
necessary to take action at the Annual Meeting. The holders of a majority of the
shares of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by
proxy will constitute a quorum of stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Votes cast
in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors
of election appointed for the Annual Meeting. The inspectors of election will
treat abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are present and entitled
to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a matter has been
approved.

                                   PROPOSAL 1

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company provide
that the Board of Directors shall consist of between three and fifteen
directors, with the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time by
the Board of Directors, and that the directors shall be divided into three
classes as nearly equal in number as possible. The Board of Directors has fixed
the number of directors on the Board at ten.

The ten members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes: Class
I (3 directors), Class II (3 directors) and Class III (4 directors). Class I, to
be elected at this Annual Meeting, will consist of three directors who are to
serve for a three year term until the 1997 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board of Directors
has designated Messrs. Erwin E. Schulze, Joel D. Spungin, and David P. Storch as
the nominees for election as Class I directors. Each of the nominees is
currently a director of the Company. Under Delaware law, the three nominees for
director who receive the greatest number of votes shall be elected directors of
the Company.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

GENERAL

The Company's executive compensation program is structured and administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Committee"), which is
composed of the five individuals listed below, all of whom are independent,
outside directors of the Company.

The executive compensation program is designed to enable the Company to attract,
motivate and retain talented executives capable of achieving strategic business
initiatives and to reward them for their achievement. The program consists of
three elements: base salaries which reflect individual capabilities and
responsibilities; annual variable cash incentive opportunities based on
individual contribution and performance; and long-term incentive opportunities,
which include a three-year cash incentive plan and a stock option/restricted
stock plan.

Total compensation opportunities for each executive are intended to be
competitive with those offered by other companies competing for their talent in
the Company's employment market. In designing and administering the individual
elements of the executive compensation program for each executive, the Committee
strives to balance short and long-term incentive objectives and employ prudent
judgment in establishing base salary levels and performance criteria, evaluating
performance and determining actual incentive payments. To ensure competitiveness
and reasonableness of the Committee's compensation decisions, independent
compensation consulting firms are retained periodically to advise the Committee
in connection with both the design and implementation of the various elements of
the program and the level of individual executive participation. Generally, as
an executive's level of responsibility increases, a greater percentage of total
compensation is based on performance, and the mix of total compensation shifts
toward stock, thereby aligning the long-term interest of senior executives with
those of stockholders.

Base salary levels of all executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, are
reviewed annually and may be adjusted depending upon the executive's
responsibilities, assessed performance contribution, qualifications and tenure
in the Company and in the position held, and competitive salary considerations
relative to similar positions at selected companies in the employment market
from which the Company draws its executives.

The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer have an annual
performance-based incentive opportunity of 0-80% of base salary. The percentage
opportunity for other executive positions varies depending on their
responsibility level. As pertains to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Operating Officer, three-fourths of their incentive opportunity is based upon
operating profit results and the remainder is based on asset management results.

The long-term incentive program consists of (i) stock option and/or restricted
stock awards granted under the Company's Stock Benefit Plan approved by
shareholders in 1992, and (ii) cash incentive performance awards vesting at the
end of a three-year performance award cycle subject to

                                       6
<PAGE>
achievement of three-year cumulative financial performance goals approved by the
Compensation Committee and continued employment through the award cycle. An
executive's participation in the various elements of the long-term incentive
program is determined by the Committee annually.

Stock option awards typically expire 10 years from the date of grant or earlier
upon termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on
successive grant anniversary dates at the NYSE closing stock price on the date
of grant, and are accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals,
stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company. In
determining stock option and restricted stock awards, the Compensation Committee
considers the recipient's position and responsibilities in the Company,
performance and contributions made during the preceding year, capabilities and
potential for future contribution to the Company and the number of options
previously granted to the recipient.

Restrictions imposed on restricted stock awards are designed, among other
things, to encourage executives to stay with the Company and to maintain a focus
on long term objectives of the Company. While restrictions may vary, typically,
they lapse as to twenty percent (20%) of the shares awarded on each successive
anniversary date of the award, and the awards are subject to forfeiture if
employment terminates for any reason during the award cycle. During the award
cycle the participant receives dividends for the shares and also has the right
to vote the awarded shares.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

The base salary level of the Chief Executive Officer has been increased
progressively since 1951 to reflect his performance, leadership and
responsibilities for increasingly complex and diversified domestic and
international operations as the Company has expanded into new product lines and
markets. Competitive compensation analyses by independent consultants are used
by the Committee to confirm that the Chief Executive Officer's base salary is at
an appropriate competitive level relative to base salaries of chief executive
officers at other companies in the relevant employment market.

In making its compensation decisions for fiscal year 1994, the Committee took
into consideration the continuing difficult and recessionary economic
environment which has for the past three years had an extraordinarily adverse
effect on the aerospace and airline/aviation industry. The Committee's action
with respect to the Chief Executive Officer's total fiscal year 1994
compensation reflects consideration of the base salary factors discussed
earlier, the existence of a company-wide salary freeze for the prior 18 month
period as well as their perception of his past and expected future
contributions, particularly the leadership role he played in the Company's
significant improvement in fiscal year 1994 performance results and in
maintaining the financial strength and liquidity of the Company.

        - The Chief Executive Officer's base salary was increased 3% on
          January 1, 1994, as were management salaries generally
          following an 18 month pay freeze.

        - The Chief Executive Officer was awarded an incentive bonus
          equal to 51% of his base salary reflecting achievement of (i) a
          31% incentive opportunity benefit for operating performance
          based on a comparison with plan and a substantial improvement
          over the prior year in consolidated net sales (up 6.5%) and net
          income (up 27% without fiscal 1993 restructuring expenses of
          $11,000,000), and (ii) a 20% incentive opportunity benefit for
          asset management, based on maintaining a strong balance sheet
          performance.

        - The Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers
          named in the Summary Compensation Table below received the
          stock options reflected in the table. The number of shares
          covered by each grant reflects individual contributions and
          performance, as well as competitive industry practices, in the

                                       7
<PAGE>
          view of the Committee. In the case of the Chief Executive
          Officer, the number of shares granted times their fair market
          exercise price equaled approximately 42% of his annual cash
          compensation.

        - The Chief Executive Officer did not receive any restricted
          stock award or long-term incentive award in fiscal year 1994.

The tables which follow and accompanying footnotes and narrative reflect the
decisions covered by the above discussion.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The Internal Revenue Code places a $1 million cap on the deductibility of
compensation, subject to certain exceptions, paid to certain executives of
publicly held corporations. Since the current levels of compensation subject to
the cap will not exceed $1 million for any executives of the Company, the
Committee did not take into consideration the deductibility of compensation for
federal income tax purposes in establishing compensation of the named executives
during the present review cycle. The Committee continues to recognize, however,
that compensation should meet standards of reasonableness and necessity, which
have been part of the Internal Revenue Code for many years.

  (1)  Mr. Johnson joined the Company as Vice President-Services and
       Manufacturing Group in June 1993. He resigned from the Company July 6,
       1994. "Other Annual Compensation" represents a relocation tax
       reimbursement for Mr. Johnson.

  (2)  As of the last day of the 1994 fiscal year, Mr. Storch held 31,738
       restricted shares with a May 31, 1994 market value of $456,234. Dividends
       are paid on all restricted shares to the same extent as any other shares
       of the Company's Common Stock.

  (3)  "All Other Compensation" includes the following: (i) contributions to the
       Company's 401(k) Plan on behalf of each of the named executives as a 1%
       match of pre-tax elective deferred contributions for 1994 (Mr. Eichner
       $1,900, Mr. Storch $2,400, Mr. Pulsifer $1,900, Mr. Johnson $800 and Mr.
       Dzurinko $1,300), and (ii) premium payment for each of the named

       Dzurinko $1,000).

  (4)  Mr. Dzurinko resigned as chief financial officer and an executive officer
       of the Company February 23, 1994.
</TABLE>

STOCK OPTIONS

The following table sets forth certain information regarding stock options
granted to the named executive officers in fiscal 1994 (the Company does not
grant stock appreciation rights). In addition, hypothetical gains or "option
spreads" that would exist for the respective options are shown based on assumed
rates of annual compound stock price appreciation of 0%, 5% and 10% required (in
the case of the 5% and 10% rates) by applicable regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission; these rates are for illustration purposes only and are
not a forecast of future appreciation. The Company did not use an alternative
formula for a grant date valuation, as the Company is not aware of any formula
which will determine, with reasonable accuracy, a present value based on future
unknown or volatile factors. The table also shows the increase in potential
realizable value of such options, if any, will be less than 1% of the increase
in potential realizable value to the other stockholders.

          (1)  Compensation level in the pension benefit calculation under the
               Retirement Plan is capped at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
               maximum under Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(17).
</TABLE>

The Company's Retirement Plan covers all named executive officers. Benefits
under the Retirement Plan are determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the
Retirement Plan and take into consideration years of credited service, a
percentage of the participant's final average compensation (the five highest
consecutive calendar years of compensation out of the employee's last ten
calendar years of employment) and adjustments for social security "covered
compensation" which is an "offset" under the Retirement Plan. The term
"compensation" means cash compensation shown as income on an employee's Form
W-2, plus amounts contributed by a participant to the Profit Sharing Plan
pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and reduced by certain
items specified in the Retirement Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
compensation for purposes of the Retirement Plan is subject to an annual
limitation in accordance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code.

The aggregate salary and bonus compensation shown for the executive officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table above is the compensation currently
included for purposes of determining benefits under the Retirement Plan. The
number of years of credited service under the Plan (effective maximum is 20
years), is as follows: Mr. Eichner, 20 years; Mr. Storch, 16 years; Mr.
Pulsifer, 7 years; Mr. Johnson, 1 year; and Mr. Dzurinko, 16 years. Benefits
under the Retirement Plan may be limited by applicable laws or regulations.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT BENEFITS

In addition to the benefits earned under the Retirement Plan, the Chief
Executive Officer is the beneficiary of a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
("SERP"). Annual retirement benefits under the SERP are equal to 60% of the
Chief Executive Officer's aggregate average of annual salary, bonus and long
term incentive cash payments ("cash compensation") for the three fiscal years
during the ten fiscal years preceding the date of his termination of active
employment during which his cash compensation was highest, subject to certain
reductions. In the case of his "involuntary retirement" prior to age 65, the
Chief Executive Officer is entitled to receive his base salary for the three
years following termination and, thereafter, to receive the retirement benefits
described above. "Involuntary retirement" means termination of the Chief
Executive Officer's employment by action of the Company (other than due to
disability), or a voluntary termination of his employment within two years
following a takeover of the Company. The Company funds the benefits through an
irrevocable trust arrangement with a bank. The level of funding is based on
actuarial computations determined by an independent actuary.

STOCKHOLDER RETURN PERFORMANCE GRAPHS

The following graphs compare the five and ten year cumulative total stockholder
return (including reinvestment of dividends) of the Company, the S&P (Standard &
Poor's) Composite--500 Stock Index, and a peer group index selected by the
Company; also included in the graphs, for transition purposes as is required by
SEC regulations, is the Value Line Aerospace/Defense Index used by the Company
in its proxy statement for fiscal 1993.

The S&P Composite--500 Stock Index is composed of domestic industry leaders in
four major sectors: Industrials, Financials, Utilities and Transportation, and
serves as a broad indicator of the U.S. equity market. The peer group index
selected by the Company is composed of companies engaged in trading, overhaul
and/or manufacturing activities in support of the aviation/aerospace aftermarket
similar to those conducted by the Company. The peer group selected by the
Company is composed of the following companies: Aviall, Inc., Banner Aerospace,
Inc., Greenwich Air Services, Inc., Hi-Shear Industries, Inc., Sequa Corp., SPS
Technologies Inc., UNC, Inc., and Wyman Gordan Co. The Value Line
Aerospace/Defense Industry Index is a broad-based industry line of business
index composed of 38 companies, including some with very large capitalizations,
from various segments of the aerospace/defense industry, in many of which the
Company does not conduct business. The Company changed to a peer group index
this year from the Value Line Aerospace/Defense Industry Index because it
believes the lines of business activities conducted by the peer group companies
more closely reflect its lines of business activities in the aviation/ aerospace
market.

The indices relate only to stock prices; they do not purport to afford a direct
comparison of the business or financial performance of the companies comprising
such indices with the Company nor with each other.

EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

Mr. Eichner has an agreement with the Company providing for employment in his
present capacity at a base compensation of $474,212 per year, effective January
1, 1994, or such increased amount as the Board may determine, and for retirement
benefits following termination of his full-time employment with the Company
pursuant to the Retirement Plan and the SERP described under "Pension Plans"
above. His term of employment is continuously extended so as to have a remaining
term of three years, but shall expire on the first to occur of his death,
disability, voluntary termination or attainment of age 68.

Upon Mr. Eichner's death, under certain circumstances, his designated
beneficiary is entitled to receive a death benefit equal to the present value of
the right of a 60 year old male to receive an annual annuity of $125,000,
subject to certain reductions.

The Company has entered into an irrevocable trust agreement with The Northern
Trust Company as trustee to fund at certain dates the Company's obligations to
Mr. Eichner and his widow or other beneficiary as described above under the
SERP. The Company will pay bonuses to Mr. Eichner (or his widow or other
beneficiary) to provide for federal, state and local income taxes incurred as a
result of contributions to the trust and income earned by trust assets. Mr.
Eichner's estate or designated beneficiary(ies) will receive any residual
amounts in the trust after payment of all retirement, death benefit and other
obligations under the Trust Agreement.

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary
each receive an annual retainer of $20,000, a fee of $1,250 for attendance at
each meeting of the Board or of any Board committee and reimbursement of
expenses. The chairman of each committee receives an additional $1,000 per
fiscal year. The Company also provides its directors with group term life
insurance coverage of $200,000. In addition, under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit
Plan, each outside director, upon becoming a director, automatically receives
stock options for 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock which can be
exercised in 25% increments each anniversary grant date at the closing NYSE
price on the date of grant. Directors who are officers or employees of the
Company or any subsidiary receive no additional compensation for service on the
Board of Directors or any of its committees.

The Company also has a Directors' Retirement Plan for its outside directors. The
Plan provides for a benefit to outside directors upon retirement on or after age
65, provided they have completed at least five years of service as a director.
Benefits are payable as a quarterly annuity in an amount equal to 25% of the
annual retainer fee payable by the Company to an active outside director.
Payment of benefits commences upon retirement and continues for a period equal
to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a director to
a maximum of ten years or death, whichever first occurs. The Directors'
Retirement Plan is unfunded. As of May 31, 1994, one former director was
receiving benefits under the Directors' Retirement Plan.
