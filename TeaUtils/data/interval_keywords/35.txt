                                PROXY STATEMENT
 
     The accompanying proxies are solicited by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on June 12,
1995 and any adjournments thereof.
 
     Holders of Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares of record at the
close of business on April 28, 1995 (the record date) will be entitled to vote
at the Annual Meeting. At that date the Corporation had issued and outstanding
2,185,223 Class A Common Shares without par value and 1,306,765 Class B Common
Shares without par value. Only Class A Common Shares are entitled to vote in the
election of the Corporation's Class I Directors, as described below. Except as
hereinafter described in respect of the election of Directors, (i) each Class A
Common Share is entitled to one vote on all matters properly coming before the
Annual Meeting, and each Class B Common Share is entitled to one-tenth (1/10th)
of one vote on all matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting, (ii) Class
A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares shall vote together as a single class
on all matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting, and (iii) an aggregate
of at least 1,745,995 Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares must be
represented at the meeting in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business.
 
     This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy were first mailed
to Shareholders on May 12, 1995.
 
                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
     The Corporation's Board of Directors currently consists of nine (9)
persons, divided into three classes (Classes I, II and III) consisting of three
Directors each. Only Class A Common Shares are entitled to vote for Directors in
Classes I and III and only Class B Common Shares are entitled to vote for
Directors in Class II.
<PAGE>   4
 
     At this Annual Meeting, Class I Directors are to be elected for a term
expiring at the 1998 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board of Directors has designated
the three (3) persons first named in the table below as nominees for Director
for such term. Each of the nominees presently is a Director.
 
     Pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended,
and in accordance with the procedures established by the American Stock
Exchange, the holders of Class A Common Shares are entitled to vote separately
as a class for the election of three Class I Directors. At least 1,092,612 Class
A Common Shares of the Corporation must be represented at the meeting in person
or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the election of such Directors.
The holders of Class B Common Shares are not entitled to vote in the election of
Class I Directors.
 
     Unless a holder of Class A Common Shares requests that voting of his or her
proxy be withheld for the nominees for election as Class I Directors in
accordance with the instructions set forth on such proxy, it presently is
intended that Class A Common Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby will
be voted for the election as Class I Directors of the nominees designated by the
Board of Directors. All nominees have consented to being named in this Proxy
Statement and to serve if elected. Should any nominee subsequently decline or be
unable to accept such nomination or to serve as a Director, an event which the
Board of Directors does not now expect, the persons voting the Class A Common
Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby may either vote such shares for a
substitute nominee for such class or for a reduced number of nominees, as they
may deem advisable.
 
     In the event holders of Class A Common Shares shall have the right to
cumulate their voting power for the election of Directors (see CUMULATIVE
VOTING), the persons voting the Class A Common Shares represented by proxies
solicited hereby shall have the right to cumulate such voting power as they
possess and to distribute their votes among the three nominees designated for
election by the holders of Class A Common Shares, as they see fit. Cumulative
voting permits a holder of Class A Common Shares to give one nominee a number of
votes equal to the number of Directors to be elected by the holders of Class A
Common Shares multiplied by the number of Shares the Shareholder may vote, or a
holder of Class A Common Shares may distribute votes on the same principle among
two or three nominees.

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
     The Corporation's compensation program is administered by the Compensation
Committee, which consists exclusively of non-employee Directors. This
compensation program is designed and administered to align the interests of the
Corporation's executive officers and its other key employees with that of the
Corporation's Shareholders, to link compensation to the performance of the
Corporation as well as to
 
                                        5
<PAGE>   8
 
individual contributions and to provide compensation at a level which is
competitive in the marketplace so that the Corporation can continue to attract,
motivate, and retain qualified management.
 
     The Corporation's compensation program for its executive officers
(including the named executive officers) and certain other key employees
consists of an annual salary, bonus (in some instances) and a long-term
incentive represented by stock options and, in some instances, deferred
compensation. The policies in respect of each of these elements, as well as the
basis for determining the compensation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, Mr. Robert S. Reitman (the "CEO"), are described below.
 
     The Compensation Committee establishes annual salaries to be competitive
with the marketplace and to reflect the varying levels of responsibilities of
the CEO and the other executive officers. Such salaries are based, in part, on
information provided to the Corporation by independent compensation consultants.
 
     The services of independent compensation consultants also are used by the
Corporation in respect of surveying compensation levels and trends in industry
generally and in respect of structuring the bonus component of the compensation
of the CEO and the other executive officers. For the Corporation's executive
officers, annual bonuses are based upon an evaluation of their respective
division's actual performance against its business plan. Assuming that
performance levels are achieved, the bonus paid is a predetermined percentage of
the division's pretax profits. In the event that predetermined standards are not
achieved, bonuses are subject to reduction. In addition to earnings performance,
the Compensation Committee evaluates other managerial achievements of the
Corporation's executive officers as a component of bonus awards.
 
     The Compensation Committee determines the annual bonus of the CEO based
upon the Corporation's sales, pretax income and return on investment
(collectively, the "Corporation Components") as well as upon a subjective factor
designed to reward individual performance independent of the Corporation
Components. The CEO's bonus is determined in part based upon the Corporation's
attaining certain threshold, target and maximum Corporation Component levels,
which levels are established based upon a Board-approved business plan for the
Corporation. The CEO's fiscal 1995 bonus was determined by weighting the
Corporation Components as follows: 45% of his 1995 bonus was based upon the
levels of Corporation Components achieved (each bearing equal weight) and 55%
was determined subjectively based upon the CEO's overall contributions to the
Corporation.

     Stock options are awarded to the Corporation's executive officers in
accordance with plans approved by the Shareholders. During the fiscal year ended
February 28, 1995, options were available for grant only under the Corporation's
1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan (The "1995 Plan"). Subject to certain
limitations and based upon management input, the Compensation Committee
determines the persons to whom options will be granted and the numbers of shares
to be represented by such options. In general, the Compensation Committee has
awarded options based upon the individual's position with the Corporation and
potential contribution to corporate profitability. The 1995 Plan provides for
the granting of incentive stock options for Class B Common Shares, the option
price of which may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares
on the date of grant. However, in the case of an optionee who owns or is deemed
to own shares of the Corporation representing more than 10% of the total voting
power of all classes of the Corporation's shares at the time an option is
granted (currently the CEO and two other executive officers), the option price
may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of
grant. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 1995, stock options were
granted under the 1995 Plan to the named executive officers in amounts indicated
later in this Proxy Statement. It is the intention of the Compensation Committee
that such grants constitute an additional tie between the Corporation's
performance and executive compensation while further aligning the common
long-term interests of the Corporation's executive officers and its
Shareholders.
 
     Stock options also have been granted to two executive officers pursuant to
their employment agreements with the Corporation. Such options were designed to
tie the interests of such executive officers, as new employees of the
Corporation, to the interest of the Corporation's Shareholders and to retain
those executive officers by linking the exercisability of their options to their
continued employment with the Corporation.
 
     In addition, the Corporation has adopted for many of its employees various
benefit plans in which the executive officers are permitted to participate,
subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the
benefits that may be payable under the plans.

                                       The Compensation Committee:

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS
 
     In 1990, the Corporation entered into employment agreements with Robert S.
Reitman and Morton L. Reitman. Robert S. Reitman's employment agreement, which
expires in June 1996, provides for an annual salary of $340,000, which salary
may be reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine if the
same should be increased. Robert S. Reitman's employment agreement also provides
for payment to Mr. Reitman of an annual incentive based upon certain performance
criteria, the maximum of which amount shall be not less than $160,000, and for
certain disability benefits.
 
     Morton L. Reitman's employment agreement with the Corporation, which
expires in June 1996, provides for an annual salary of $242,000, which salary
may be reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine if the
same should be increased, and for certain disability benefits. Morton L. Reitman
also has a consultant agreement with the Corporation providing for payment to
Mr. Reitman for consulting services in the amount of $72,000 per year, for a
term of three years commencing upon the termination of his employment.
 
     In 1991, the Corporation entered into an employment agreement with James C.
Spira. Mr. Spira's employment agreement, which expires in February 1996,
provides for an annual salary of $240,000, which salary may be reviewed
periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine if the same should be
increased, and for certain disability benefits. In addition, pursuant to Mr.
Spira's employment agreement, the Corporation granted to Mr. Spira options to
purchase 70,000 Class B Common Shares of the Corporation, the exercise price of
which options is $14.50, the fair market value of such shares on the date of the
grant. The options become exercisable (so long as Mr. Spira shall be a full-time
employee of the Corporation on such date) as follows: 15,000 options on February
28, 1993; 10,000 options on February 28, 1994; 9,000 options on February 28,
1995; 9,000 options on February 29, 1996; 9,000 options on February 28, 1997;
9,000 options on February 28, 1998; and 9,000 options on February 28, 1999.
 
     Mr. Spira may exercise such options during a period of five years from and
after the date on which the last options become exercisable. In the event of the
termination of employment by Mr. Spira for any reason, any options to which Mr.
Spira shall have become entitled to purchase as of the date of such termination
expire 90 days after such date if the same are not purchased. However, in the
event that Mr. Spira's employment is terminated without cause, Mr. Spira has the
right to purchase all of the
 
                                       12
<PAGE>   15
 
options not purchased previously, whether or not the same have become
exercisable, within 90 days of such termination.
 
     In March 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation entered into an
employment agreement with Mr. Dennis H. Kelly. Mr. Kelly's employment agreement,
which expires in February 1998, provides for an annual salary of $120,000 plus
incentives based upon performance.
 
     The Corporation also has deferred compensation agreements with certain key
employees which provide for benefits for a term of 10 years following
retirement, disability or death. These benefits vary according to the employee's
corporate responsibility and the age of the employee at the date of such event.
The ranges of annual benefits under the deferred compensation agreements for
Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and Morton L. Reitman during the first five years of
said term are $32,400 to $68,400 and $14,400 to $36,600, respectively. The
amount of benefits payable to such executive officers during the second five
years of the term is 75% of the benefit payable during the first five years.
 
     The benefits payable to Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and Morton L. Reitman
under the deferred compensation agreements will be replaced with the benefits
payable to them under the Corporation's 1992 Supplemental Benefit Plan (the
"Supplemental Benefit Plan") upon the vesting of each such individual's rights
in that plan. Vesting under the Supplemental Benefit Plan does not occur unless
and until that individual has been a participant in the plan for 10 years or has
attained age 65, whichever first occurs; provided, however, that a participant
who becomes disabled or dies shall be vested after six years of employment by
the Corporation. In addition, in the event that effective control of the
Corporation changes from that management in control at the date of adoption of
the Supplemental Benefit Plan, all participants immediately vest in the plan
benefits. Under the Supplemental Benefit Plan, Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and
Morton L. Reitman will receive $140,000 and $60,000, respectively, in annual
benefits for a term of 15 years following their retirement, death or disability.
In the event that either individual's rights under the Supplemental Benefit Plan
fail to vest, then the benefits under the deferred compensation agreements
remain payable to such non-vested individual.

                 BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF CLASS A COMMON SHARES
                           AND CLASS B COMMON SHARES
 
     The following tables, together with the accompanying footnotes, describe
the beneficial ownership of the Corporation's Class A Common Shares and Class B
Common Shares as of April 28, 1995 (except as otherwise indicated) of (1) each
person who was known to the Corporation to be the beneficial owner of more than
five percent of the total Shares of either class issued and outstanding on such
date, and (2) each current Director and nominee for election as Director, as
well as all executive officers and Directors as a group. Except as otherwise
indicated, the share figures shown below are based upon information supplied by
the named individuals and group members described in the tables and the
Corporation's records.
 
     As used in the tables, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of all
shares in respect of which such person has or shares voting or investment power
(regardless of whether such individual is entitled to receive any economic
benefits derived from such shares). As used herein, "voting power" means the
power to vote, or to direct the voting of, shares and "investment power" means
the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, shares. Also, included
are shares which were not owned on April 28, 1995 but which can be acquired
within 60 days after that date.
 
     As indicated specifically in the footnotes to the tables, certain Class A
Common Shares and Class B Common Shares included for the named individuals in
each table below are deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one of such
named individuals and, as a result, have been so reported. Certain individuals
listed in the tables have disclaimed beneficial ownership with respect to some
of the Shares disclosed as beneficially owned under the definition set forth
above.

Marwick be selected as independent auditors to examine the books, records and
accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending
February 29, 1996. In accordance with past practice, the recommendation is being
presented to holders of Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares for
adoption or rejection at the Annual Meeting. KPMG Peat Marwick were the
independent auditors of the Corporation for the fiscal year ended February 28,
1995 and are considered by the Board of Directors to be well qualified.
Representatives of KPMG Peat Marwick are expected to be present at the Annual
Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are
expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.

                        COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF
                      THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
 
     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
Corporation's executive officers and Directors, and persons who beneficially own
more than 10% of the Corporation's Common Shares, to file reports of ownership
and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sylvia K.
Reitman and David J. Golden have the exclusive power, acting in concert, to
direct the voting and disposition of the Class A Common Shares and Class B
Common Shares held by the Louis B. Golden Trust u/a/d October 20, 1980 (the
"Trust"). Although such authority was determined in connection with the
administration of the estate of their mother, Miriam G. Golden, such authority
was deemed to have been granted on the date of Mrs. Golden's death in May, 1994.
As a result, Sylvia K. Reitman, Robert S. Reitman and David J. Golden were
deemed to own beneficially, and were required to report their beneficial
ownership of, the shares held of record by the Trust as of the date of Mrs.
Golden's death; their respective reports of beneficial ownership were filed
subsequent to such date. James C. Spira reported his receipt of a stock option
grant in June, 1994 subsequent to the due date for such reporting.
 
                                 OTHER MATTERS
 
     The Board of Directors knows of no matter to be presented for action at the
Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. Should other
matters come before the meeting, the Class A Common Shares and Class B Common
Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby will be voted with respect
thereto in accordance with the best judgment of the proxy holders.
 
                              GENERAL INFORMATION
 
CUMULATIVE VOTING
 
     If notice in writing is given by any holder of Class A Common Shares to the
President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Corporation, not less than
forty-eight hours before the time fixed for the holding of the Annual Meeting,
that such Shareholder desires that the voting with respect to the election of
Directors shall be cumulative, and if an announcement of the giving of such
notice is made upon the convening of the meeting by the Chairman or Secretary of
the Meeting or by or on behalf of the Shareholder giving such notice, each
holder of Class A Common Shares shall have the right to cumulate such voting
power as he or she possesses at such election.

VOTING OF PROXIES
 
     Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares represented by properly
executed Management proxies will be voted at the meeting, and if a holder of
such shares has specified how the same are to be voted, they will be voted in
accordance with such specification. It is intended that Class A Common Shares
represented by proxies in which no specification has been made will be voted for
the election of Directors and Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares
represented by proxies in which no specification has been made will be voted for
the selection of the independent auditors.
 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
 
     If a holder of Class A Common Shares or Class B Common Shares intends to
present a proposal at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders presently
scheduled for June 11, 1996, it must be received by the Corporation for
consideration for inclusion in the Corporation's Proxy Statement and form of
proxy relating to that meeting on or before January 12, 1996.
 
REVOCATION OF PROXIES
 
     A proxy may be revoked at any time before a vote is taken or the authority
granted is otherwise exercised. Revocation may be accomplished by the execution
of a later proxy with regard to the same Class A Common Shares or Class B Common
Shares, as the case may be, or by giving notice in writing or in open meeting.
 
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
 
     The cost of soliciting the accompanying proxies will be borne by the
Corporation. The Corporation does not expect to pay any compensation for the
solicitation of proxies but may pay brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and
custodians their reasonable expenses for sending proxy material to principals
and obtaining their instructions. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies
may be solicited in person, by telephone or telegraph, or by Directors, officers
and regular employees of the Corporation.
