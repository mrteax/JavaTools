                            To Be Held May 20, 1997

               Furnished By The Board of Directors of The Company

                                                                  April 18, 1997

The Board of Directors of ACCEL  International  Corporation (the  "Company"),  a
Delaware corporation,  is soliciting proxies, the form of which is enclosed, for
the Annual Meeting of  Stockholders to be held on May 20, 1997. The cost of such
solicitation  will be borne by the  Company.  Officers,  directors  and  regular
employees of the Company may  communicate  with  stockholders  personally  or by
mail,  telephone,  telegram  or  otherwise  for the purpose of  soliciting  such
proxies,  but  the  Company  will  pay  no  additional   compensation  for  such
solicitation.  The Company and any authorized  agent of the Company will request
brokers  and  other  custodians,  nominees  and  fiduciaries  to  forward  proxy
soliciting  material to the  beneficial  owners of shares held of record by such
persons and will reimburse the reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in forwarding
such material. This Proxy Statement is being mailed on or about April 21, 1997.

Any stockholder  giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it
is voted by a later  appointment  received by the Secretary of the Company or by
giving  notice of such  revocation to the Secretary of the Company in writing or
in open meeting. All duly executed proxies received prior to the meeting and not
revoked will be voted at the meeting. The enclosed proxy contains space in which
the stockholder may insert instructions as to the way the stockholder wishes his
shares to be voted.  When such proxy is  properly  executed  and  returned,  the
shares  it  represents  will  be  voted  at  the  meeting  as  directed.  If  no
specification  is  indicated,  the shares  will be voted  "For" the  election as
directors of the nominees listed below under "Election of Directors".

April 4,  1997  has  been  fixed as the  record  date for the  determination  of
stockholders entitled to such notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any
adjournments thereof. On that date the total number of outstanding shares of the
Company  entitled to vote at the meeting was  8,603,742  shares of Common Stock,
$.10 par value, (the "Common  Stock"). The holder of each share of such stock is
entitled  to  one  vote.  Pursuant  to  applicable  law,  broker  non-votes  and
abstentions  will not be  counted  in favor of or against  the  election  of any
nominee for director or any other proposals to be presented at the meeting.  Any
stockholder  who abstains from voting on any such other  proposal will in effect
be voting against it.

                            1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

In accordance  with the Bylaws of the Company,  the number of directors has been
fixed  at nine by  action  of the  Board of  Directors.  Directors  are  elected
annually to serve until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and until their
successors are elected and qualified.  The election of directors is decided by a
plurality of the votes cast by the shares  entitled to vote in the election.  In
the absence of instructions to the contrary,  it is the intention of the persons
named in the proxy to vote the proxies  for the  election  as  directors  of the
persons  nominated  below.  Although  the  Board of  Directors  has no reason to
believe that any of the  nominees  set forth below will not serve,  in the event
that  vacancies  occur,  the  proxies  will be voted  for the  election  of such
nominees,  if any, as shall be  designated  by the Board of  Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof.

           SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section  16(a) of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934  (the  "Exchange  Act")
requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10%
of the Common Stock,  to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with
the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC").  Officers,  directors and
greater than 10%  stockholders  are required by SEC  regulations  to furnish the
Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it or written
representations  from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were required of
them, the Company  believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1996,
all filing requirements  applicable to its officers,  directors and greater than
10% stockholders were complied with.

                             THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR

                       COMMITTEES, MEETINGS AND FUNCTIONS

The Board of  Directors  of the  Company  met four (4)  times  during  1996.  No
director  attended  fewer than 75% of the total  number of meetings of directors
and of any committees on which he served. The Board of Directors has established
an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee. It does
not have a Nominating Committee.

The Executive  Committee,  which  exercises the powers of the Board of Directors
between regular  meetings of the Board, did not meet during 1996. The membership
of the Executive Committee consists of Messrs. Friedberg, Chase, Deck, Hicks and
Qua. The Audit  Committee  met one (1) time during 1996 to review the results of
the  audit  of the  Company's  1995  financial  statements  by  the  independent
auditors,  review  the  scope  of the  1996  audit,  consider  relevant  matters
pertaining  to  internal  controls  and  accounting  procedures,  perform  other
customary  functions of Audit  Committees,  and to make a recommendation  to the
Board of Directors on the  engagement  of  independent  auditors for fiscal year
1996. The membership of the Audit  Committee  consists of Messrs.  Qua, Deck and
Hicks.

The  Compensation  Committee  met four (4) times  during 1996 for the purpose of
reviewing employee compensation and benefit arrangements.  The membership of the
Compensation  Committee  consists of Messrs.  Deck, Hicks and Qua. The Report of
the Compensation Committee is contained below.

Compensation of Directors
- - -------------------------
During 1996,  non-employee  directors  of the Company  continued to abide by the
one-third  reduction in compensation  levels  initiated in 1993, and accordingly
received  an  annual  retainer  of  $5,000  plus a fee of $500 per  meeting  for
attending any regular or special meetings of the Board of Directors. The members
of each committee of the Board of Directors, other than officers of the Company,
received  a fee of $500  for  each  meeting  attended.  Chairmen  of  committees
received a fee of $750 for each meeting attended.

The  First  Restatement  of  the  ACCEL  International  Corporation  1987  Stock
Incentive  Plan (the "Restated  Plan")  provides for options to be granted every
year to  non-employee  directors  of the Company for a  predetermined  number of
shares of Common Stock.  In 1991,  the year the Restated  Plan was adopted,  the
non-employee directors were granted options for 2,000 shares each. In subsequent
years,  options  for  1,000  shares  each  were  granted  and will  continue  to
automatically  be granted  according to the Restated Plan (subject to adjustment
for stock dividends,  stock splits and other similar events). Newly appointed or
elected non-employee  directors are granted options for 2,000 shares in the year
they are appointed or elected, and thereafter will receive the automatic grants.
The exercise  price is equal to the fair market value of a share of stock on the
date the option is granted.  Options become  exercisable as to 50% of the shares
subject to the option on  completion of each full year prior to  termination  of
the  director's  status as director  after the date the option was granted.  The
options lapse on the earliest of the date 10 years after the option was granted,
or the date 180 days after the termination of the director's status as director.
The options shall fully vest and become completely exercisable upon the death or
voluntary  retirement of a director.  The provisions of the 1996 Stock Incentive
Plan (the "1996  Plan")  adopted in 1996,  are  substantially  identical  to the
Restated Plan pertaining to non-employee directors.

Compensation Committee
- - ----------------------
Executive Compensation including the grant of stock options is determined by the
Compensation  Committee  of the Board of  Directors.  The  formal  report of the
Compensation Committee with respect to 1996 compensation is as follows:


                      REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Company's  compensation  package for its executive officers consists of base
salary, participation in a profit sharing plan for senior officers, and periodic
stock option grants or awards.  The base salary for Mr. Friedberg,  the Chairman
of the Board,  President and Chief Executive Officer,  is fixed by the Committee
and  may be  adjusted  as  determined  periodically  by the  Committee  after  a
performance review is conducted.  As of June 1, 1996, the Committee formulated a
compensation  arrangement for Mr. Friedberg to include base salary and authorize
a stock option to be granted.  A similar  compensation  arrangement was approved
for Mr. Coats on the recommendation of Mr. Friedberg. Base salary levels for all
other executive  officers are determined by Mr. Friedberg and recommended to the
Committee.  The amount of profit sharing compensation and stock option grants or
awards,  if any, are also determined by this Committee.

Based on Mr.  Friedberg's  more than thirty  years  experience  and  performance
record as an executive at other companies in the insurance industry, his role in
negotiating and  restructuring the finances of the Company at year-end 1995, and
his efforts in new product line development,  the Committee  established a total
aggregate annual compensation level for Mr. Friedberg of $350,000, subject to an
annual review,  with an allocation of the $350,000 between cash compensation and
stock  options to be  determined  each May by the  Committee.  The stock options
granted for this purpose are valued by calculating  the  difference  between the
book value and market value per share as of the date of grant. The annual review
takes into account Company  performance,  comparative  industry data and various
subjective  considerations of individual performance as well as corporate goals.
For 1996,  the monthly cash  compensation  was set at $20,000  beginning on June
1st, and stock options were awarded based on the approximate  difference between
book and market value of one dollar ($1.00) per share.

The Committee  believes that a significant  or meaningful  portion of total cash
compensation  should be related to  profitability  and the  achievement of fixed
objectives.  Consequently,  the  profit  sharing  potential  for  the  Company's
executive   officers   is   conditioned   on   overall   corporate   performance
(profitability),  and achieving individual and departmental objectives tied to a
percentage of total base salary.


                                        6
<PAGE>

Generally speaking,  base salary levels are set and adjusted at levels which are
part of the Company's budgetary process, yet are believed by the Committee to be
sufficient to attract and retain  qualified  executives when considered with the
other components of the Company's compensation structure.

In previous  years,  profit  sharing plans had been adopted for all employees of
the Company and for senior officers. The overall objectives for establishing the
Company's  incentive  compensation  programs were to enhance total  compensation
without  adding fixed  expense,  modify the  corporate  reward  systems and give
managers  the  discretion  to reward  contributors,  better  focus  management's
attention on the  achievement  of  objectives  and drive  accountability  to all
levels of the Company, and foster teamwork.

For 1996,  no profit  sharing goal was set for  employees  and senior  officers.
Accordingly,  no profit sharing compensation was paid to any employees or senior
officers in 1996. In addition to approving an ACCEL Bonus Plan, the Compensation
Committee  determines annual stock option grants or awards to executive officers
and other  eligible  employees.  Stock  options are  intended to  encourage  key
employees to remain  employed by the Company by providing  them with a long-term
interest in the Company's overall performance as reflected by the performance of
the market of the Company's Common Stock.

Option Repricing Report
- - -----------------------
In August,  1996, all employees who held outstanding options under the Company's
stock option plans, including the three executive officers whose status predated
May,  1995,  were given the  opportunity  to reprice  outstanding  stock options
granted during the period from September 17, 1986 to October 3, 1995 to the then
current  market price of $2.50 per share.  Employees  who accepted the repricing
opportunity  surrendered  for  cancellation  the previously  granted options and
received new options granted under the terms of the 1996 Plan. Vesting under the
1996 Plan commences on the first anniversary of the date of grant and vests at a
rate of 25% per year.

The  Company  took this  action to retain  key  employees  whose  experience  is
valuable to the Company,  to maintain employee morale, and provide the incentive
for increasing  stockholder  value.  The following table sets forth  information
regarding such repricing options held by the executive officers of the Company:

                 RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT PUBLIC AUDITORS

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP has served as the independent auditors for the company for
each of the years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31, 1996. In recent
years, it has been the practice of the Board of Directors to annually review and
select independent  auditors for the Company.  The Board of Directors intends to
continue such practice and to make the selection of  independent  auditors later
in the year. The selection of  independent  auditors has not therefore been made
for the current  fiscal year.  Representatives  of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP will be
present at the Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  with an  opportunity  to make a
statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions,  if any, of
the stockholders of the Company.


                              STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Stockholders  wishing to submit proposals for the Company's 1998 Proxy Statement
may do so prior to December 22, 1997 by letter  addressed to the Company in care
of the Secretary.


                                 OTHER MATTERS

Management does not know of any other business to be presented for consideration
at the meeting.  If any other business properly comes before the meeting, or any
adjournment  or  adjournments  thereof,  the proxy  holders  will vote in regard
thereto according to their discretion insofar as such proxies are not limited to
