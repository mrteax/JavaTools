                                 PROXY STATEMENT


         This proxy statement is furnished to you in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by your Board of Directors to be used at the 1999 annual
meeting of stockholders of ACCEL International Corporation, a Delaware
corporation.


DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING

         We will hold the 1999 annual meeting of stockholders on November 16,
1999, at 10:00 a.m., local time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof,
at the offices of Day, Berry & Howard LLP, 25th Floor, CityPlace I, Hartford,
Connecticut, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual
Meeting of Stockholders.


MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE MEETING

         At the meeting, we will ask our stockholders to consider and vote upon
the election of directors to serve until our next annual meeting.

         The stockholders will also consider and vote upon such other matters as
may properly be brought before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.


VOTE REQUIRED

         A plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or
by proxy and entitled to vote will elect directors. This means that the
directors receiving the greatest number of votes cast will be elected. With
regard to the election of directors, you may vote in favor of or withhold your
vote from each nominee; and votes that are withheld will be excluded entirely
from the vote and will have no effect. There is no cumulative voting with
respect to the election of directors.

         Pursuant to applicable law, broker non-votes and abstentions will not
be counted in favor of any proposal presented at the meeting or the election of
any nominee for director. Abstentions and broker non-votes will also not count
against the proposal to elect directors.


VOTING OF PROXIES

         Shares of our common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received in time for the meeting, unless previously revoked, will be voted at
the meeting as specified by the stockholders on the proxies. If no specification
is made, shares represented by these proxies will be voted in favor of the
election of directors as recommended by your Board of Directors.

         If any other matters properly come before the meeting for
consideration, the person or persons named in the form of proxy enclosed
herewith and acting thereunder will have discretion


<PAGE>   5

to vote on the matters in accordance with their best judgment, unless the proxy
indicates otherwise. We have no knowledge of any matters to be presented at the
meeting other than those matters referred to and described in this proxy
statement.


REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

         If you give a proxy, you have the power to revoke it at any time before
it is voted. You can do so in one of three ways. First, you can send written
notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy to our Secretary at the
address given below. Second, you can complete a new proxy card and send it to
our Secretary at the address given below. Third, you can attend the meeting and
vote in person. You should send any written notice or new proxy card to:

                                DOUGLAS J. COATS
                PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND SECRETARY

                             STAFFORD, TX 77497-1949


         You may request a new proxy card by calling Douglas J. Coats at (281)
565-8010.


RECORD DATE; STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM

         Only stockholders of record at the close of business on September 28,
1999 will be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the
record date, 8,554,966 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Each
share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter on which the
holders of common stock are entitled to vote. A majority of the outstanding
shares of common stock entitled to vote must be represented in person or by
proxy at the meeting in order for a quorum to be present.


SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

         Your Board of Directors is soliciting proxies, the form of which is
enclosed, for the meeting. The cost of this solicitation will be borne by us.
Our officers, directors, or employees may communicate with stockholders
personally or by mail, telephone, telegram or otherwise for the purpose of
soliciting proxies. We and our authorized agents will request brokers and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy soliciting material to the
beneficial owners of shares held of record by these persons and will reimburse
their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding the material. This proxy
statement is being mailed on or about November 5, 1999.

NOMINEES FOR DIRECTORS

         In accordance with our bylaws, the Board of Directors has fixed the
number of directors at nine. Directors are elected annually to serve until the
next annual meeting of stockholders, and until their successors are elected and
qualified. The election of directors is decided by a plurality of the votes cast
by the shares entitled to vote in the election. In the absence of instructions
to the contrary, the persons named in the enclosed proxy intend to vote the
proxies for the election as directors of the persons nominated below. Although

duly authorized committee of it may designate.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         Since October 1, 1998 Mr. Deck, as Chairman of the Board, is paid at
the annual rate of $100,000. He also received a grant of 100,000 options
exercisable at $2.25 per share. During 1998, we continued also to pay our
non-employee directors at the reduced compensation levels initiated in 1993.
Accordingly our non-employee directors received an annual retainer of $5,000
plus a fee of $500 per meeting for attending any regular or special meetings of
the Board of Directors. The members of each committee of the Board of Directors,
other than officers of ACCEL, received a fee of $500 for each meeting attended.
Chairmen of committees received a fee of $750 for each meeting attended.

         The 1996 Stock Incentive Plan of ACCEL International Corporation
provides for options to be granted every year to our non-employee directors for
a predetermined number of shares of common stock. This plan, as amended by the
stockholders in 1998, provides that newly appointed or elected non-employee
directors are granted options for 10,000 shares in the year they are appointed
or elected, and thereafter will receive annual automatic grants of options to
purchase 10,000 shares. The exercise price is equal to the fair market value of
a share of stock on the date the option is granted. Options become exercisable
as to 50% of the shares subject to the option on completion of each full year
prior to termination of the director's status as director after the date the
option was granted. The options lapse on the earliest of the date 10 years after
the option was granted, or the date 180 days after the termination of the
director's status as director. The options shall fully vest and become
completely exercisable upon the death or voluntary retirement of a director.


MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         Your Board of Directors met four times during 1998. No director
attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of directors and of any
committees on which he served. The Board of Directors has established an
Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee. It does
not have a Nominating Committee.

         The Executive Committee, which exercises the powers of the Board of
Directors between regular meetings of the Board, did not meet during 1998. The
membership of the Executive Committee consists of Messrs. Chase, Coats, Deck
(Chairman), Hicks and Qua.

         The Audit Committee met one time during 1998 to review the results of
the audit of our 1997 financial statements by our independent auditors, review
the scope of the 1998 audit, consider relevant matters pertaining to internal
controls and accounting procedures, perform other customary functions of Audit
Committees, and to make a recommendation to the Board of

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

        Our compensation package for our executive officers consists of base
salary, participation in a profit sharing plan for senior officers, and periodic
stock option grants or awards. The committee fixed and determined the base
salary for Mr. Friedberg, former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer, after a performance review was conducted. As of June 1, 1996,
the committee had formulated a compensation arrangement for Mr. Friedberg to
include base salary and a stock option to be granted. A similar compensation
arrangement was approved for Mr. Coats, our current President and Chief
Executive Officer, on

                                       10
<PAGE>   14

the recommendation of Mr. Friedberg. Our Chief Executive Officer determines and
recommends to the committee base salary levels for all other executive officers.
The committee also determines the amount of profit sharing compensation and
stock option grants or awards, if any.

        Based on Mr. Friedberg's experience and performance, the committee
established a total aggregate annual compensation level for Mr. Friedberg of
$350,000, subject to an annual review, with an allocation of the $350,000
between cash compensation and stock options to be determined annually by the
committee. Until his retirement, Mr. Friedberg was paid at the rate of $300,000
and was granted 60,000 options at $3.218. The stock options granted for this
purpose were valued by calculating the difference between the book value and
market value per share as of the date of grant. The annual review took into
account ACCEL's performance, comparative industry data and various subjective
considerations of individual performance as well as corporate goals.

        Mr. Friedberg retired from the Company effective September 30, 1998 and
Mr. Coats took over the responsibilities of President and CEO. His salary was
increased from an annual rate of $150,000 to $200,000 based on his increased
responsibilities. Mr. Deck, an outside director, became Chairman of the Board. A
special meeting of the Compensation Committee with Mr. Qua acting as Chairman
established Mr. Deck's compensation as executive Chairman at $100,000 annually
and granted him 100,000 options at $2.25, the current market price of the stock.

        In previous years, profit sharing plans had been adopted for all
employees of ACCEL and for senior officers. The overall objectives for
establishing ACCEL's incentive compensation programs were to enhance total
compensation without adding fixed expense, modify the corporate reward systems
and give managers the discretion to reward contributors, better focus
management's attention on the achievement of objectives and drive accountability
to all levels of ACCEL, and foster teamwork. For 1998, no profit sharing goal
was set for employees and senior officers. Accordingly, no profit sharing
compensation was paid to any employees or senior officers in 1998.

             SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

         Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors,
and persons who own more than 10% of the common stock, to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by Securities
and Exchange Commission regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section
16(a) forms they file.

         Based solely on our review of the copies of the forms received by us or
written representations from some reporting persons that no Forms 5 were
required of them, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31,
1998, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater
than 10% stockholders were complied with.

                     RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

         KPMG Peat Marwick LLP has served as our independent auditor for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1998. In recent years, it
has been the practice of the Board of Directors to annually review and select
independent auditors of ACCEL. The Board of Directors intends to continue this
practice and to make the selection of the independent auditors later in the
year. The selection of the independent auditors has not therefore been made for
the current fiscal year. Representatives of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP will be
present at the meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement, if
desired, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions, if any, of
our stockholders.


                              STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

         Stockholders wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in our 2000
proxy statement may do so prior to July 5, 2000 by letter addressed to us in
care of our corporate secretary. If we change the date of our 2000 annual
meeting by more than 30 days from the date of our 1999 annual meeting, then
stockholders must submit proposals a reasonable time before we begin to print
and mail the proxy statement for our 2000 annual meeting.

         On May 21, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted an
amendment to Rule 14a-4, as promulgated under the Exchange Act. The amendment to
14a-4 (c)(1) governs our use of discretionary proxy voting authority with
respect to a stockholder proposal which the stockholder has not sought to
include in our proxy statement. The new amendment provides that if a proponent
of a proposal fails to notify us at least 45 days prior to the month and day of
mailing of the prior year's proxy statement, then the management proxies will be
allowed to use their discretionary voting authority when the proposal is raised
at that meeting, without any discussion of the matter in the proxy statement. It
also provides that if the date of the 2000 annual meeting has changed more than
30 days from the 1999 annual meeting and if the proponent of a proposal fails to
notify us a reasonable time before we mail our proxy statement for the 2000
annual meeting, then the management proxies will have the same discretionary
voting authority.

         With respect to our 2000 annual meeting of stockholders, if we are not
provided notice of a stockholder proposal which the stockholder has not
previously sought to include in our proxy

                                       13
<PAGE>   17

statement by September 20, 2000, or within a reasonable time before we mail our
proxy statement if we change the date of our 2000 annual meeting by more than 30
days from the date of this year's meeting, the management proxies will be
allowed to use their discretionary authority as outlined above.


                                  OTHER MATTERS

         As of the date of this proxy statement, we do not expect any matters
other than these described in this proxy statement will be brought before the
meeting. If any other business properly comes before the meeting, or any
adjournment of the meeting, the proxy holders will vote in regard to the other
business according to their discretion insofar as the proxies are not limited to
the contrary.

         YOU SHOULD RELY ON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT TO DECIDE HOW TO VOTE ON THE MATTERS TO BE
CONSIDERED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING. WE HAVE NOT AUTHORIZED ANYONE TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH INFORMATION THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM OR IN ADDITION TO WHAT IS CONTAINED IN

SORT, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON IT. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS PROXY
