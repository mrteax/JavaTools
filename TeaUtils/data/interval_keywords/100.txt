(A) Amounts shown include cash compensation earned and received by the executive
    officers. There are no other forms of non-cash compensation or other
    perquisites for any executive officer.

    The Company has a Management Compensation Plan based upon earnings of the
    Company. As a guideline, the plan provides that participants may share in an
    incentive fund equal to 12% of pretax earnings, provided such pretax
    earnings amount to at least a 10% return on the Company's equity. However,
    both the participants and the amount of bonus are discretionary, provided
    the total amount of bonuses paid do not exceed the total incentive fund
    available. In addition, the Company may offer separate incentives and
    commissions on an individual basis.

(B) The amounts shown in this column represent contributions made by the Company
    to the Company's Thrift, Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan ("Plan"). The
    Plan provides that all nonunion employees employed on a full time or part
    time salaried basis are eligible to participate on the first day of January
    or July after twelve consecutive months of employment. The Company
    contributes amounts, as determined by the Board of Directors, to be
    allocated among the participants according to a formula based upon the
    employee's years of service and compensation. A participant becomes vested
    at the rate of 20% per year commencing after two years of service.

    Directors who are not employees of the Company are paid an annual fee of
    $4,000.

EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENT:

     The Board of Directors has authorized an arrangement under which Mr. Henry
W. Nozko, Sr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will receive a
five-year consulting agreement if and when he retires or otherwise ceases
employment. The annual consulting fee will be based on Mr. Nozko's last year of
employment. In the event of Mr. Nozko's death, the remainder of the consulting
fee would be paid as a death benefit funded with the proceeds of life insurance
policies owned by the Company.

            REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of a
non-employee director. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board of
Directors as to policies which govern both annual compensation and stock
ownership programs for the Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive
officers. Each year, salaries are determined and awards are made, if warranted,
under the Management Compensation Plan.

     The Committee annually evaluates the Company's performance, executive
compensation and incentive programs compared with our industry and with a
broader group of companies.

     The Company's compensation programs are designed to reward executives for
long-term strategic management and the enhancement of shareholder value, and are
leveraged on the basis of performance in terms of both cash compensation and
incentive plans, paying more with good performance and less when it is

                                        5
<PAGE>   8

below standard. The Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers
received salary increases of 3% effective January 1, 2000.

     On December 16, 1999, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors
repriced the outstanding Class A stock options. The Committee repriced the
options to maintain the incentive nature of the options. Stock options are
necessary to advance the interests of the Company by providing Directors and
Officers with an additional incentive, increasing their proprietary interest in
the success of the Company and encouraging them to remain employees and/or
directors of the Company.

     During 2000, the Compensation Committee will continue to carefully consider
executive compensation in relation to the Company's performance compared to that
of industry performance levels.

     The Company has no formal employment agreements.

     The Company has been advised by KPMG LLP that no member of that firm has
any direct financial interest or any material indirect financial interest in the
Company and that it has never had any connection with the Company in the
capacity of promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director or employee.

     Representatives of KPMG LLP will be present at the meeting and will be
afforded the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. Such
representatives will be available to respond to questions from the Company's
stockholders regarding the Company's financial statements.

the Company at its offices addressed to its Secretary no later than April 1,
2001 to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy
relating to the 2001 Annual Meeting.

                                    GENERAL

     The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. The only costs
anticipated are those ordinarily incurred in connection with the preparation and
mailing of proxy material.

     In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited personally or
by telephone by certain directors, officers and regular employees of the Company
in the ordinary course of the performance of their duties and without extra
compensation for such work.

the meeting, but if any other matters should properly come before the meeting,
the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote on such matters in
accordance with their best judgment. The shares represented by all effective
proxies received by management will be voted. Unless otherwise specified in the
proxy forms which are returned to management, such proxies will be voted as
follows: (1) "FOR" the election, as directors, of the six nominees of the Board
of Directors which are set forth under the heading "Election of Directors"; and
(2) "FOR" the approval of the selection of KPMG LLP as auditors.
