                               GENERAL INFORMATION


INFORMATION ABOUT PROXY SOLICITATION

         This Proxy Statement is furnished to the holders of the common stock,
$.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Aceto Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company") in connection with the solicitation of proxies on
behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for use at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders to be held on Thursday, December 5, 2002 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern
Standard Time), at the Company's offices, One Hollow Lane, Suite 201, Lake
Success, New York 11042, and at any adjournment thereof. The purposes of the
meeting and the matters to be acted upon are set forth in the accompanying
Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At present, the Board of Directors
knows of no other business which will come before the meeting.

         The Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement, and form of proxy will
be mailed to Shareholders on or about October 25, 2002. The Company will bear
the cost of its solicitation of proxies. The original solicitation of proxies by
mail may be supplemented by personal interview, telephone, telegram, and telefax
by the directors, officers and employees of the Company. Arrangements will also
be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for
the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held
by such persons, and the Company may reimburse such custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
therewith.

REVOCABILITY AND VOTING OF PROXY

         A form of proxy for use at the meeting and a return envelope for the
proxy are enclosed. Shareholders may revoke their proxies at any time before
being voted. Shares of Common Stock represented by executed and unrevoked
proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions specified thereon. If
no instructions are given, the proxies will be voted FOR the election of
management's seven nominees for election as directors; FOR ratification of the
adoption of the Company's 2002 Stock Option Plan; and FOR ratification of the
appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 2003.

                                       1

RECORD DATE AND VOTING RIGHTS

         Only stockholders of record at the close of business on September 16,
2002 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof. On September 16, 2002, the Company had outstanding 6,539,709 shares of
Common Stock, each of which is entitled to one vote upon matters presented at
the meeting.

         Votes cast at the meeting will be tabulated by persons appointed as
inspectors of election of the meeting. The inspectors of election will treat
shares of Common Stock represented by a properly signed and returned proxy as
"present" at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, without regard to
whether the proxy is marked as casting a vote or abstaining. Likewise, the
inspectors of election will treat shares of Common Stock represented by "broker
non-votes" as present for purposes of determining a quorum.

         Under New York law, (i) a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual
Meeting is necessary to elect directors, and (ii) the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required to ratify the
adoption of the Company's 2002 Stock Option Plan and to ratify the appointment
of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the current fiscal year.

         Shares represented by proxies designated as broker non-votes will be
counted for purposes of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes occur when a
broker nominee (which has voted on one or more matters at a meeting) does not
vote on one or more other matters at a meeting because it has not received
instructions to so vote from the beneficial owner and does not have
discretionary authority to so vote. Shares represented by proxies designated as
broker non-votes, however, will not be treated as being cast for purposes of
determining the outcome of a vote on any matter.

         A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be
available at the Company's office, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New York
11042, during business hours, for a period of 10 days prior to the Annual
Meeting for examination by any shareholder. Such list will also be available at
the Annual Meeting.

QUORUM

         The presence, either in person or by proxy, of the holders of a
majority of the shares of common stock outstanding on September 16, 2002 is
necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         Directors of the Company who are not also employees receive $20,000 per
year for serving on the Board of Directors plus $1,000 for each committee
meeting attended. Directors of the Company who are also employees are not
compensated for their services as Directors.

         On December 6, 2001, the Company granted each of Messrs. Eilender,
Hendler, Schaer, Schlesinger, Wiesen and Fischer 2,000 non-qualified stock
options pursuant to the 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan. Each option vests one
year from the date of grant, is exercisable at $9.84 and expires 10 years from
the date of grant.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

         On March 26, 2001, in conjunction with Aceto's acquisition of
Schweizerhall Pharma, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an employment
contract with Dr. Axel Mueller. The contract has a term of three years, with an
initial salary of $200,000 plus annual increases at a rate equal to that which
other senior Aceto executives receive and a minimum annual bonus of $125,000
(including restricted stock awards). In addition, Dr. Mueller received an option
for 2,500 shares of Aceto's common stock at 100% of the Fair Market value at
that date. Dr. Mueller is also to be provided with an automobile for his use.

         The Company has no other employment agreements with its senior
executives.

LIMITS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

         The Company's Articles of Incorporation eliminate the personal
liability of its directors to the Company and its shareholders for monetary
damages for breach of the directors' fiduciary duties in certain circumstances.
The Articles of Incorporation further provide that the Company will indemnify
its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Company
believes that such indemnification covers at least negligence and gross
negligence on the part of the indemnified parties. Insofar as indemnification
for liabilities under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors,
officers, and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing
provisions or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy
as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION.

         Members of the Executive Compensation Committee, with the exception of
Leonard S. Schwartz, have never served as officers or employees of the Company
or any of our subsidiaries. During the last fiscal year, none of our senior
executives served on the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of any
other entity whose officers served either on our Board of Directors or
Compensation Committee.

                 REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are Leonard S.
Schwartz (Chairman), Stanley H. Fischer, Samuel I. Hendler, Albert L. Eilender
and Robert A. Wiesen, functions as the Executive Compensation Committee, and
makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the remuneration of the
Company's executive officers.

                                       8
<PAGE>

The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the Company to
attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and abilities will
contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum profitability to
the Company and its stockholders, by providing salaries and benefits competitive
with those offered by other companies in the chemical industry. The executive
compensation program includes base salary, annual incentive compensation (cash
bonuses), and long term incentive compensation (awards under the Company's Stock
Option Plans).

Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the chemical industry. Because
of the way the Company operates its business, the contributions of its
executives significantly affect corporate profitability. Bonuses (which can
exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such contributions. The
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) also is the Chairman of the Board, President and
Chief Operating Officer of the Company. The bonuses paid to the CEO and to the
Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), are intended to
reflect the Company's overall performance (excluding extraordinary events).

The four highest paid executives, other than the CEO, are each responsible for
the performance of one of the Company's principal profit centers. Internally
generated performance records are kept on a monthly and yearly basis for these
profit centers, and each center's profitability is compared in the current year
to the previous year. Other factors considered in determining the bonuses of
individual executives are the individual's own performance and the overall
performance of the Company. The Executive Compensation Committee determines each
bonus primarily based on this data, also taking into account the long term
contributions of each individual.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION

The CEO's compensation was determined on the basis of the same factors utilized
to compensate other executives, taking into consideration total compensation
comparisons of top executives of corporations considered to be in the Company's
peer group.

                          REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

         We operate in accordance with a written charter adopted by the Board of
Directors, a copy of which was disseminated to stockholders as Appendix 1 to the
Proxy Statement for the December 7, 2000, annual meeting of stockholders. We met
with KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), the independent auditors both with and without
management present, to review the scope and results of the audit engagement, the
system of internal controls and procedures, and the effectiveness of procedures
intended to prevent violations of laws and regulations. We reviewed all services
performed by KPMG for the Company in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, within
and outside the scope of the quarterly reviews and annual auditing functions.

         We received the following information concerning the fees of the
independent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, and considered
whether the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the
independence of the independent auditors:

              for advisory services related principally to tax consultation
              services, business consulting services and transaction support services.
</TABLE>

         We reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, with management, and discussed with KPMG the
matters required to be discussed by SAS 61(Codification of Statements on
Auditing Standards, AU Sec. 380) as amended. We also received the written
disclosures and letter from KPMG required by Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1, which letter states that they are independent accountants with
respect to the Company. We discussed with KPMG their independence. Based on our
review and discussions, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the
audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, for filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

         We have reviewed our charter and determined that it continues to state
appropriate guiding principles for us.

         Our committee is composed solely of members who are independent and
have the expertise to serve on the Audit Committee pursuant to all relevant
criteria including Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASD listing standards.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE SEVEN
DIRECTORS.

                                  PROPOSAL TWO

RATIFY THE ADOPTION OF THE COMPANY'S 2002 STOCK OPTION PLAN.

         We are asking you to ratify the adoption of the Company's 2002 Stock
Option Plan ("Plan") which will enable us to grant stock options, either in
incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards
or other stock based awards ("Awards") totaling up to 500,000 shares of our
common stock. The Board has adopted the Plan, subject to your ratification at
the Annual Meeting.

SUMMARY OF THE PLAN

         We summarize below certain key provisions of the Plan. Because it is a
summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. Before
you decide how to vote, you should review the full text of the Plan, which we
have included as Exhibit A.

                    DESCRIPTION OF THE 2002 STOCK OPTION PLAN

PURPOSES AND ELIGIBILITY

         The purposes of the Plan are to attract, retain and motivate eligible
participants to compensate them for their contributions to our growth and
profits and to encourage them to own Aceto common stock. The Aceto Corporation
2002 Stock Option Plan authorizes the issuance of certain awards to such
individuals. Eligible participants are employees (including officers and
directors of the company or its affiliates), non-employee directors, advisors,
consultants or independent contractors to the Company or its affiliates.

SHARES AVAILABLE, OVERALL LIMIT

         A total of 500,000 shares of common stock will be authorized for
issuance under the Plan. We will adjust the number of shares available for
issuance under the Plan if there are changes in our capitalization, including
(but not limited to) stock dividends, stock splits, a merger, reorganization or
similar transactions. We may issue new shares or treasury shares or both.
Treasury shares are shares that we previously issued and subsequently
repurchased and are holding in our treasury.

                                       14
<PAGE>

ADMINISTRATION

         The Plan will be administered by the Board. The Executive Committee of
the Board will make recommendations to the Board as to which participants from
among the eligible participants shall receive awards and determines the form,
terms and conditions of awards. The Board makes all awards under the Plan, and
has sole discretion with regard to any award.

AWARDS GENERALLY

         The Plan authorizes the following awards based upon Aceto common stock:
stock options; restricted stock; or other stock-based awards the Committee
determines to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan and the interests of
Aceto. The Board determines vesting, exercisability, payment and other
restrictions that apply to an award. Vesting means the individual has the right
to the award.

CHANGE IN CONTROL

         A change in control of Aceto (generally a merger or consolidation into
another company or a "person" becoming beneficial owner of 20% or more of
Aceto's voting stock without concurrence of the Board) will cause all
outstanding awards to vest, become immediately exercisable, and have all
restrictions lifted. (The change in control provision could be viewed as having
an anti-takeover consequence, in that it could have a deterrent effect against a
hostile takeover).

STOCK OPTIONS

         All stock options issued will be either incentive stock options or
non-qualified stock options. The exercise price per share shall be not less than
the fair market value of Aceto common stock on the date of grant and may not be
exercisable less than six months from the date it is granted. The exercise price
of a stock option may be paid in cash or previously owned stock or both, or such
other means as the committee may prescribe.

         Under the Plan, options to purchase the Company's Common Stock may take
the form of incentive stock options ("ISOs") under Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or non-qualified stock options
("NQSOs"). As required by Section 422 of the Code, the aggregate fair market
value (as defined in the Plan) of shares of Common Stock (determined as of the
date of grant of the ISO) with respect to which ISOs granted to an employee
which first become exercisable may not exceed $100,000 in any calendar year. The
foregoing limitation does not apply to NQSOs.

         Initially, each option will be exercisable over a period, determined by
the Board in its discretion, of up to ten years from the date of grant. Options
may be exercisable during the option period at such time, in such amounts, and
in accordance with such terms and conditions and subject to such restrictions as
are determined by the Board and set forth in option agreements evidencing the
grant of such options. The Board may grant options with vesting schedules based
on the Company's publicly traded share price exceeding predetermined levels for
designated periods of time and/or the passage of time so that the option becomes
fully exercisable in installments.

         The exercise price of options granted pursuant to the Plan is
determined by the Board, in its discretion; provided that the exercise price of
an ISO may not be less than 100% of the fair market value (as

                                       15
<PAGE>

defined in the Plan) of the shares of the Company's Common Stock on the date of
grant. The exercise price of options granted pursuant to the Plan is subject to
adjustment as provided in the Plan to reflect stock dividends, splits, other
recapitalizations or reclassifications or changes in the market value of the
Company's Common Stock. In addition, the Plan provides that, in the event of a
proposed change in control of the Company (as defined in the Plan), the Board is
to take such actions as it deems appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the
Plan and to protect the grantees of options, which action may include (i)
acceleration or change of the exercise dates of any option; (ii) arrangements
with grantees for the payment of appropriate consideration to them for the
cancellation and surrender of any option; and (iii) in any case where equity
securities other than Common Stock are proposed to be delivered in exchange for
or with respect to Common Stock, arrangements providing that any option shall
become one or more options with respect to such other equity securities.
Further, in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates (other than pursuant
to a plan of merger or reorganization), then notwithstanding any restrictions on
exercise set forth in the Plan or any grant agreement pursuant thereto (i) each
grantee shall have the right to exercise his option at any time up to ten days
prior to the effective date of such liquidation and dissolution; and (ii) the
Board may make arrangements with the grantees for the payment of appropriate
consideration to them for the cancellation and surrender of any option that is
so canceled or surrendered at any time up to ten days prior to the effective
date of such liquidation and dissolution. The Board also may establish a
different period (and different conditions) for such exercise, cancellation, or
surrender to avoid subjecting the grantee to liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act.

         Except as permitted pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and
in any event in the case of an ISO, an option is not transferable except by will
or the laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the options be exercised
later than the expiration date specified in the option agreement.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

         Restricted Stock awards may be awarded to an eligible participant in
lieu of a portion of cash bonus earned by the participant. These restricted
shares will vest over a period of years as determined by the Board at the time
of grant and will not be transferable until vested. In addition, awards of
Restricted Stock may have a premium paid in additional shares when fully vested.
There may be other restrictions as the Board may determine.

OTHER EQUITY AWARDS

         The Board upon recommendation of the Committee has the authority to
specify the terms and provisions of other forms of equity-based awards or
equity-related awards not described above which the Committee determines to be
consistent with the purposes of the Plan and the interests of Aceto.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES

         One of the objectives of the Plan is that certain designated employees
be stockholders. The Plan contains guidelines for stock ownership, relative to
the positions and base salaries of the employees involved. Restricted Stock
awards can be used to satisfy these requirements.

TERMINATION

         No awards shall be made after ten years from September 5, 2002,
assuming the adoption of the Plan is ratified by the Company's shareholders.

                                       16
<PAGE>

AMENDMENT

         We may amend or terminate the Plan at any time. However, we must obtain
stockholder approval to increase the maximum number of shares issuable or reduce
the exercise price of a stock option.

         Also, we may not amend or terminate the 2002 Stock Option Plan without
an employee's consent if it would adversely affect an employee's rights to
previously-granted awards.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

         The following is a brief summary of certain Federal income tax aspects
of awards under the Plan based upon the Federal income tax laws in effect on the
date hereof. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not describe
state or local tax consequences.

         INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. An optionee will not realize taxable income
upon the grant of an ISO. In addition, an optionee will not realize taxable
income upon the exercise of an ISO, provided that such exercise occurs no later
than three months after the optionee's termination of employment with the
Company (one year in the event of a termination on account of disability).
However, an optionee's alternative minimum taxable income will be increased by
the amount that the fair market value of the shares acquired upon exercise of an
ISO, generally determined as of the date of exercise, exceeds the exercise price
of the option. If an optionee sells the shares of Common Stock acquired upon
exercise of an ISO, the tax consequences of the disposition depend upon whether
the disposition is qualifying or disqualifying. The disposition of the shares is
qualifying if made more than two years after the date the ISO was granted and
more than one year after the date the ISO was exercised. If the disposition of
the shares is qualifying, any excess of the sale price of the shares over the
exercise price of the ISO would be treated as long-term capital gain taxable to
the option holder at the time of the sale. If the disposition is not qualifying,
i.e., a disqualifying disposition, the excess of the fair market value of the
shares on the date the ISO was exercised over the exercise price would be
compensation income taxable to the optionee at the time of the disposition, and
any excess of the sale price of the shares over the fair market value of the
shares on the date the ISO was exercised would be capital gain.

         Unless an optionee engages in a disqualifying disposition, the Company
will not be entitled to a deduction with respect to an ISO. However, if an
optionee engages in a disqualifying disposition, the Company generally will be
entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of compensation income taxable to
the optionee.

         NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. An optionee will not realize taxable
income upon the grant of an NQSO. However, when the optionee exercises the NQSO,
the difference between the exercise price of the NQSO and the fair market value
of the shares acquired upon exercise of the NQSO on the date of exercise is
compensation income taxable to the optionee. The Company generally will be
entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of compensation income taxable to
the optionee.

SECTION 3. ADMINISTRATION.

(i) designation of Participants; (ii) the type or types of Awards to be granted
to an Eligible Participant; (iii) the number of Shares to be covered by Awards;
(iv) terms and conditions of Awards; and (v) unless otherwise expressly provided
in the Plan, designations, determination, interpretations, and suggested
decisions with respect to the Plan or any Award.

         (b) Authority of Board. All Awards under the Plan shall be made by the
Board, which shall have full authority to accept, reject or modify any
recommendations of the Committee. All designations, determinations,
interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to the Plan or any
Award shall be within the sole discretion of the Board, may be made at any time
and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all Persons, including the
Company, any Affiliate, any Participant, any holder or beneficiary of any Award,
and any stockholder.

SECTION 4. SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS.

         (a) Shares Available. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section
4(b), the number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted under the
Plan shall be five hundred thousand (500,000). If, after the effective date of
the Plan, any Shares covered by an Award granted under the Plan are forfeited,
or if such an Award terminates or is canceled without the delivery of shares,
then the Shares covered by such Award, or the number of Shares otherwise counted
against the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be
granted, to the extent of any such forfeiture, termination or cancellation,
shall again become Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted. In the
event that any Option or other Award granted hereunder is exercised through the
delivery of Shares or in the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from
such Award are satisfied by the withholding of Shares by the Company, the number
of Shares available for Awards under the Plan shall be increased by the number
of Shares so surrendered or withheld.

         (b) Adjustments. In the event that any dividend (other than regular
dividends) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other
securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock
split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
repurchase, or exchange of Shares, or other similar corporate transaction or
event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to
prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended
to be made available under the Plan, then adjustment shall be made, in such
manner as shall be equitable, of (i) the number of Shares with respect to which
Awards may be granted, (ii) the number of Shares subject to outstanding Awards,
and (iii)

<PAGE>

the grant or exercise price with respect to any Award, provided, that with
respect to any Award no such adjustment shall be made to the extent that such
adjustment would be inconsistent with the Plan's meeting the requirements of
Section 162(m) of the Code, as from time to time amended.

         (c) Sources of Shares Deliverable under Awards. Any Shares delivered
pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and
unissued Shares or of treasury Shares.

SECTION 5. ELIGIBILITY.

         Any employee (including an officer, Executive Officer or director) of
the Company or any Affiliate, including any non-employee director, advisor,
consultant or independent contractor to the Company or any Affiliate, shall be
an Eligible Participant. To the extent the Board deems it necessary, appropriate
or desirable to comply with foreign law or practice and to further the purpose
of this Plan, the Board may, without amending this Plan, (i) establish rules
applicable to Awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals, are
employed outside the United States, or both, including rules that differ from
those set forth in this Plan, and (ii) grant Awards to such Participants in
accordance with those rules.

SECTION 6. STOCK OPTIONS - TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

         All Options granted under the Plan shall be either Incentive Stock
Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options and shall be evidenced by Award
Agreements which shall be subject to applicable provisions of the Plan and such
other provisions as they may contain including:

         (a) Price. The exercise price per Share shall not be less than 100% of
the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of Award.

         (b) Period. The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee may
establish the term of any Option award under the Plan, provided, however, that
an Option shall expire no later than 10 years from the date of Award, and may
not be exercisable less than six months from the date it is granted.

         (c) Time of Exercise. The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee,
may grant Options to Participants with vesting schedules based on the Company's
publicly traded share price exceeding predetermined levels for designated
periods of time, and/or the passage of time, such that the Option becomes fully
exercisable in a series of installments. The Board, upon recommendation of the
Committee, may also establish other conditions of exercise and may accelerate
the exercisability of any Option granted to a Participant under the Plan.

         (d) Payment. No Shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of
an Option until payment in full of the option price in cash, or its equivalent,
or by exchanging Shares owned by the optionee (which are not the subject of any
pledge or other security interest), or by a combination of the foregoing,
provided that the combined value of all cash and cash equivalents and the Fair
Market Value of any such Shares so tendered to the Company as of the date of
such tender is at least equal to such option price.

         (e) Exercise. An Option, or portion thereof, shall be exercised by
delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Company. A Participant shall not
have any of the rights or privileges of the holder of Common Stock until such
time as Shares of Common Stock are issued or transferred to the Participant.

<PAGE>

         (f) Restrictions on Incentive Stock Options. The aggregate Fair Market
Value (determined as of the Grant Date) of shares of Common Stock with respect
to which all Incentive Stock Options first become exercisable by any grantee in
any calendar year under this or another plan of the Company and its Affiliates
may not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may be permitted from time to
time under Section 422 of the Code. To the extent that such aggregate Fair
Market Value shall exceed $100,000, or other applicable amount, such Options
(taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted) shall be
treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options. In such case, the corporation may
designate the shares of Common Stock that are to be treated as stock acquired
pursuant to the exercise of any Incentive Stock Option by issuing a separate
certificate for such shares and identifying the certificate as Incentive Stock
Option shares in the stock transfer records of the Company.

         The exercise price of any Incentive Stock Option granted to a grantee
who owns (within the meaning of Section 422(b)(6) of the Code, after the
application of the attribution rules in Section 424(d) of the Code) more than
10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares of the
Corporation or its Parent or Subsidiary corporations (within the meaning of
Sections 422 and 424 of the Code) shall be not less than 110% of the Fair Market
Value of the Common Stock on the grant date and the term of such Option shall
not exceed five years.

         (g) Other Terms and Conditions. Options may contain such other
provisions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee
shall determine appropriate from time to time. No Option shall be an Incentive
Stock Option unless so designated by the Committee at the time of grant or in
the Grant Agreement evidencing such Option.

SECTION 7. RESTRICTED STOCK

         (a) Grant by Company. The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee,
shall have authority to determine the Participants to whom Shares of Restricted
Stock (including Premium Shares, as defined below) shall be granted, the number
of Shares of Restricted Stock to be granted to each Participant, and the other
terms and conditions of such Awards.

         (b) Participant Election. Each Participant may elect Restricted Stock
in lieu of a portion of any annual cash bonus earned by such Participant up to
20% of such annual cash bonus. Such election is a one-time election to be made
annually during a Trading Window, as defined in the Company's Trading Policy,
with the right to amend the election in writing up to a maximum of two times per
fiscal year during Trading Windows only. Such Restricted Stock will vest ratably
over a period of years as determined by the Board. Such Restricted Stock may
have a premium in shares (the "Premium Shares") greater than the portion of the
bonus to be paid in Restricted Shares, as determined by the Board, which Premium
Shares shall be delivered to the Participant when the Award is fully vested,
provided that the Participant is in the employ of the Company when vesting
occurs.

         (c) Transfer Restrictions. The Company shall deliver certificates for
Restricted Shares to the Participant or the Participant's legal representative
upon the lapse of all restrictions applicable to such shares of Restricted
Stock.

<PAGE>

         (d) Payment. Each share of Restricted Stock shall be paid in Shares,
upon the lapse of the restrictions applicable thereto, or otherwise in
accordance with the applicable Award Agreement.

         (e) Rights of Ownership. The Participant shall have all rights of
ownership to the Restricted Stock, including voting rights, dividends and other
distributions paid on or in respect of any Shares of Restricted Stock, except
for rights of transfer, which shall not exist until vesting has occurred.


SECTION 8. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

         (a) In the event a Participant (other than a Non-Employee Director)
shall cease to be employed by the Corporation while he is holding one or more
Options, each outstanding Option which is exercisable on the date of such
termination shall expire at the earlier of the expiration of its term or one
year, unless the Board determines otherwise.

         Unless otherwise determined by the Board, any portion of an Option held
by a Participant (other than a Non-Employee Director) that is not exercisable on
the date such Participant's employment terminates shall expire as of such
termination date.

         (b) Restricted Stock. In the event of a Participant's retirement,
permanent and total disability, or death, or in cases of special circumstances,
the Board may, when it finds that a waiver would be in the best interest of the
Company, waive in whole or in part, any or all remaining restrictions with
respect to such Participant's entitlement to shares of Restricted Stock,
including any Premium Shares. In the event of a Participant's death while in the
employ of the Company, any or all remaining restrictions with respect to such
Participant's entitlement to shares of restricted stock shall be deemed waived
by the Board.

SECTION 9. TERMINATION OF SERVICE AS A DIRECTOR

         (a) In the event a Director shall cease to serve as a Director of the
Corporation while he or she is holding one or more Options, each outstanding
Option which is exercisable as of the date of such termination shall expire at
the earlier of the expiration of its term or one year, unless the Board
determines otherwise.

         Unless otherwise determined by the Board, any portion of an Option held
by a Director which has not become exercisable as of the date a Director ceases
to serve as a Director of the Corporation shall terminate as of such date.

SECTION 10. CHANGE IN CONTROL.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, upon a
Change in Control all outstanding Awards shall vest, become immediately
exercisable or payable and have all restrictions lifted as may apply to the type
of Award.

<PAGE>

SECTION 11. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.

         (a) Amendments to the Plan. The Board may amend, alter, suspend,
discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided
that no such amendment, alteration, suspension discontinuation or termination
shall be made without stockholder approval to: increase the number of shares
issuable; reduce the exercise price of Options or extend the termination period
of the Plan. The Board, however, may not amend or terminate the Plan without a
Participant's consent insofar as it would adversely affect a Participant's
rights to previously granted Awards.

         (b) Cancellation. Any Award granted hereunder may be canceled with the
approval and agreement of the Participant in consideration of a cash payment or
alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to
the Fair Market Value of such canceled Award.

SECTION 12. GENERAL PROVISIONS

         (a) Nontransferability. No Award shall be assigned, alienated, pledged,
attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant, except
by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a QDRO.

         (b) No Rights to Awards. No Participant or other Person shall have any
claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of
treatment of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and
conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.

         (c) Share Certificates. All certificates for Shares or other securities
of the Company delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise
thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as
the Board may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon
which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable
Federal or state laws, and a legend or legends may be put on any such
certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

         (d) Withholding. A Participant may be required to pay to the Company
and the Company shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold from
any Award, from any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the
Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount
(in cash, or Shares), of any applicable withholding taxes in respect of an
Award, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the Plan
and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company
to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.

         (e) Award Agreements. Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an
Award Agreement that shall be delivered to the Participant and shall specify the
terms and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable thereto.

         (f) No Right to Employment. The grant of an Award shall not be
construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the
Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time
dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim
under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award
Agreement.

         (g) Rights as Stockholder. No holder of an Award of stock options or
beneficiary of any such Award shall have any rights as a stockholder with
respect to such options until he or she has exercised such option and

<PAGE>

become the holder of Shares. In connection with each grant of Restricted Stock
hereunder, the applicable Award shall be entitled to the rights of a stockholder
in respect of such Restricted Stock, except for such transfer restrictions as
may be applicable thereto.

         (h) Governing Law. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan
and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall
be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

         (i) Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or
becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any
Award under any applicable law, such provision shall be construed or deemed
amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or
deemed amended without, in the determination of the Board, materially altering
the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such
jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award
shall remain in full force and effect.

         (j) Other Laws. The Company may refuse to issue or transfer any Shares
or other consideration under an Award if, it determines that the issuance or
transfer of such shares might violate any applicable law or regulation or
entitle the Company to recover the same under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act,
and any payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or
beneficiary in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly
refunded to the relevant Participant, holder, or beneficiary. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, no Award granted hereunder shall be construed
as an offer to sell securities of the Company, and no such offer shall be
outstanding, unless the Board has determined that any such offer, if made, would
be in compliance with all applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities
laws any other laws to which such offer, if made, would be subject.

         (k) No Trust Fund Created. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create
or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the
extent that any Person acquires rights pursuant to an Award, such rights shall
be no greater than the rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

         (l) No Obligation to Exercise Options. The granting of an Option shall
impose no obligation upon the Participant to exercise such Option.

         (m) Plan Expenses. Any expenses of administering this Plan shall be
borne by the Company.

         (n) No Warranty of Tax Effect. Except as may be contained in any Award

SECTION 13. RESTATEMENT OF SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES.

         (a) Applicability. The Board established the one-time Share ownership
guidelines in connection with its adoption of the Company's 1998 Omnibus Equity
Award Plan. These guidelines are restated in paragraph 13 (d) below. These
guidelines are applicable to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company ("CEO")
and to managerial Participants designated by the Board (together, "Designated
Participants").

<PAGE>

         (b) Measurement. Share ownership guidelines are in terms of the Fair
Market Value of Shares to be owned relative to the positions held and the base
salaries of the Designated Participants. Ownership levels and guidelines will be
reviewed (and if advisable modified) by the Board (upon recommendation of the
Committee) periodically, based on internal reports and overall operations of the
Company.

         (c) Targeted Levels. Designated Participants will either from inception
of the Company's 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan or commencement of employment
have five years to reach the targeted guideline levels of Share ownership set
forth in Paragraph 13 (d) below (except, that if a Designated Participant's Base
Salary is increased from under $100,000 to $100,000 or more, such Participant
will have only three years from the date of the increase in Base Salary to reach
the targeted guideline level of share ownership), which levels can be changed,
modified, or suspended by the Board. Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant
shall be included in calculating Shares owned.

         (d) Guidelines. The one-time share ownership guidelines are as follows:

                  (i)      The CEO shall at all times own Shares with a Fair
                           Market Value equal to two times his or her Base
                           Salary.
                  (ii)     All other Designated Participants with a Base Salary
                           of less than $100,000 shall at all times own Shares
                           with a Fair Market Value equal to one-half his or her
                           Base Salary.
                  (iii)    All other Designated Participants with a Base Salary
                           of $100,000 or more shall at all times own Shares
                           with a Fair Market Value equal to his or her Base
                           Salary.

SECTION 14. EFFECTIVE DATE; TERMINATION DATE

         The Plan is effective as of September 5, 2002, the date on which the
Plan was adopted by the Board, subject to approval of the shareholders within
twelve months of such date. Unless previously terminated, the Plan shall
terminate on the close of business on September 5, 2012, ten years from its
effective date. Subject to other applicable provisions of the Plan, all Options
granted under the Plan prior to termination of the Plan shall remain in effect
until such Options have been satisfied or terminated in accordance with the Plan
and the terms of such Options.
