                             PROXY STATEMENT

          The following information is furnished in connection with the 
solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company for the 
annual meeting of shareholders to be held on Wednesday, August 21, 1996,
at 4:00 P.M., Atlanta time, in the Board Room of the Company, at the
above address.  A copy of the Company's annual report for the fiscal year
ended April 30, 1996, and a proxy for use at the meeting are enclosed with
this proxy statement.  This proxy statement and the enclosed proxy were
first mailed to shareholders on or about July 19, 1996.

                             GENERAL INFORMATION

          Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked, 
without compliance with any other formalities, by any shareholder who attends 
the meeting and gives oral notice of his or her election to vote in person.  
In addition, any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked 
prior to the meeting by delivering to the President of the Company a notice 
of revocation or a duly executed proxy for the same shares bearing a later 
date.  All proxies of shareholders solicited by the Company which are 
properly executed and received by the President of the Company prior to the 
meeting, and which are not revoked, will be voted at the meeting.  The shares 
represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions 
thereon, and unless specifically instructed to vote otherwise, the 
individuals named in the enclosed proxy will vote to elect all the nominees 
as set forth in this proxy statement.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will 
be included in determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, 
but will otherwise have no effect on the election of the nominees for 
Director.  A system administered by the Company's transfer agent will 
tabulate the votes cast.

          The cost of soliciting proxies is paid by the Company.  Copies of 
solicitation material may be furnished to banks, brokerage houses and other  
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding to beneficial owners of 
shares of the Company's common stock, $1.00 par value per share (the "Common 
Stock"), and normal handling charges may be paid for such forwarding service. 
 In addition to soliciting by mail, Directors and regular employees of the 
Company, at no additional compensation, may assist in soliciting proxies by 
telephone or telegraph.

          As of July 15, 1996, the record date for the annual meeting, there 
were 2,970,856 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote.  The 
holders of Common Stock, the only class of voting stock of the Company 
outstanding, are entitled to one vote per share.

                        NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

          The Board of Directors recommends the election of the ten (10) 
nominees listed on pages 2 and 3 to constitute the entire Board to hold 
office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their 

                               1
<PAGE>
successors are elected and qualified.  If, at the time of the 
annual meeting, any of such nominees should be unable to serve, the persons 
named in the proxy will vote for such substitutes or vote to reduce the 
number of Directors for the ensuing year as management recommends.  
Management has no reason to believe that any substitute nominee or nominees 
or reduction in the number of Directors for the ensuing year will be 
required.  The affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast is required 
to elect the nominees.

          All of the nominees are now Directors of the Company and have 
served continuously since their first election.  The following information 
relating to: (1) age as of August 21, 1996; (2) directorships in other 
publicly-held companies; (3) positions with the Company; (4) principal 
employment; and (5) Common Stock owned beneficially as of June 30, 1996, has 
been furnished by the respective nominees.  Except as otherwise indicated, 
each nominee has been or was engaged in his present or last principal employme
nt, in the same or a similar position, for more than five years.

</TABLE>
                  BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

          The objectives of the Company's compensation program are to enhance 
the profitability of the Company, and thus shareholder value, by aligning 
compensation with business goals and performance and attracting, retaining 
and rewarding Executive Officers who contribute to the long-term success of 
the Company.  In furtherance of these goals, the Company's compensation 
program for Executive Officers includes base salary, annual bonus and, in 
some cases, stock option incentives.  In addition, at the discretion of the 
Board of Directors, selected Executive Officers may participate in the Senior 
Management Deferral Plan, which is designed to permit eligible employees to 
defer a portion of their incentive compensation.  No Executive Officer who is 
also a Director participated in deliberations concerning his own salary.

          SALARY.  The Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of 
Directors of a subsidiary company, as the case may be, determines the base 
salary for the Executive Officers, including the CEO, based upon the 
financial performance (including profitability and/or revenues) of the 
Company or subsidiary, as the case may be, and upon the individual's level
of responsibility, time with the Company, contribution and performance. 
Evaluation of these factors is subjective, and no fixed, relative weights
are assigned to the criteria considered.  The beginning point for determining
the salary is the base salary the Executive Officer received in the prior
fiscal year.  Neither the CEO nor the President received a salary increase
for fiscal 1996.

          BONUS.  The majority of the Bonuses and All Other Compensation 
reported in the Summary Compensation Table was paid pursuant to the Company's 
profit-sharing plan.  In general, all employees meeting certain service 
requirements are eligible to participate in this plan.  The aggregate 
contribution of the Company is set annually by the Board of Directors and 
then allocated based on the eligible compensation of participants.  Year-end 
cash bonuses are also based on each employee's salary.  As a result, 
profit-sharing plan allocations are based on the same factors as are the 
salaries of the Executive Officers.  

                                   7
<PAGE>
          The Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of 
a subsidiary company, as the case may be, also determines the amount of an 
annual cash bonus, separate from the profit-sharing plan, for certain of the 
Executive Officers.  These bonuses are based upon the financial performance 
(including profitability and/or revenues) of the Company or subsidiary, as 
the case may be, and upon the individual's level of responsibility, time with 
the Company, contribution and performance.  During the most recently 
completed fiscal year, neither the CEO nor the President received any such 
annual cash bonus.

          STOCK OPTIONS.  The Company also maintains a stock option plan to 
provide additional incentives to certain employees to maximize shareholder 
values.  Options granted pursuant to this plan utilize vesting periods to 
encourage key employees to continue in the employ of the Company.  The 
Company has granted options from time to time to a limited number of 
employees, including grants prior to fiscal 1996 to two of the executive 
officers other than the CEO.  During fiscal 1996, the Company did not grant 
any options to the CEO or any Executive Officer named in the Summary 
Compensation Table.

          The Company does not anticipate that the law that serves to cap 
executive compensation that is deductible by the Company at $1,000,000 will 
have any impact on the compensation policies of the Company.

          The tables included in the proxy statement and accompanying 
narrative and footnotes, reflect the decisions covered by the above 
discussion.  The foregoing report has been furnished by the members of the 
Board of Directors:

                   Bernard W. Abrams                     Richard H. Danielson
                   Edward M. Abrams                      Donald W. MacLeod
                   Alan R. Abrams                        L. Anthony Montag
                   J. Andrew Abrams                      Joseph H. Rubin
                   Paula Lawton Bevington                Felker W. Ward, Jr.

                         DIRECTORS COMPENSATION

          Each Director is paid a retainer of $550 per month and a fee of 
$1,200 per Board of Directors meeting attended.  In addition, Directors who 
are members of the Audit Committee, but who are not Officers of the Company, 
are paid a fee of $600 for each Audit Committee meeting attended.

          DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN.  The Company maintains a 
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") 
under which members of the Board of Directors of the Company may elect to
defer to a future date receipt of all or any part of their compensation
as Directors and/or as members of a committee of the Board.  For purposes
of the Deferred Compensation Plan, "compensation" means the retainer fees
and meeting fees payable to such Directors by the Company in their
capacities as Directors or as members of the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors.

          The Deferred Compensation Plan is administered by the Executive 
Committee of the Board of Directors.  A committee member may not participate 
in any decision relating in any way to his individual rights or obligations 
as a participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

                               8
<PAGE>
          The Company will make payments of deferred compensation and the 
earnings on such deferred compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan 
at the time specified by each participant in a lump sum or, at the sole 
discretion of the participant, in no more than five equal annual 
installments.  For the year ended April 30, 1996, five members of the Board 
of Directors (including three Executive Officers who are also Directors) 
participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan.
