                         ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                             TO BE HELD MAY 7, 1999
                                 ---------------


         This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the shareholders of K-Tron
International, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders of the Company to be held on May 7, 1999 and any postponements or
adjournments thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the
enclosed Proxy Card are being mailed to shareholders on or about March 26, 1999.

         Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card are being solicited by
and on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for the purposes set
forth in the foregoing notice of meeting. The costs incidental to the
solicitation and obtaining of proxies, including the cost of reimbursing banks
and brokers for forwarding proxy materials to their principals, will be borne by
the Company. Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by officers
and employees of the Company by mail, telephone, telefax, personal interviews
and other methods of communication.

         The Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 2,
1999, including consolidated financial statements and other information with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, is being mailed to shareholders
with this Proxy Statement. Such Annual Report is not part of this Proxy
Statement.


                              VOTING AT THE MEETING

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED; PROXIES

         Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 1999
are entitled to notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting.
As of that date, the Company had outstanding 2,945,605 shares of Common Stock.
The holders of a majority of such shares, represented in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is necessary before
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting except that, even if a quorum
is not present, the shareholders present in person or by proxy shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Each
shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to one vote for each share of
Common Stock outstanding in such shareholder's name.

         The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed Proxy
Card will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the
shareholder signing such Proxy Card. The Proxy Card provides space for a
shareholder to vote for the nominee, or to withhold authority to vote for the
nominee, for the Board of Directors. The nominee for election as a director is
to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. With
respect to any other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual
Meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders
entitled to vote thereon is required to take action, unless a greater percentage
is required either by law or by the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or
<PAGE>   4
By-Laws. For determining the number of votes cast with respect to any voting
matter, only those cast "for" or "against" are included. Abstentions will be
considered present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be
counted as votes cast. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on the vote.
Similarly, where brokers submit proxies but are prohibited and thus refrain from
exercising discretionary authority in voting shares on certain matters for
beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions with respect to such
matters (commonly referred to as "broker non-votes"), those shares will be
considered present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be
counted as votes cast as to such matters and thus will have no effect on the
vote.

         If a signed Proxy Card is returned and the shareholder has given no
direction with respect to a voting matter, the shares will be voted with respect
to that matter by the proxy agents as recommended by the Board of Directors or
its Executive Committee. Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card will
not affect a shareholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in
person. Any shareholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it by giving
notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time before the
proxy is voted.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

         The following table sets forth certain information as of February 28,
1999 (or as of such other date as may be noted below) with respect to shares of
Common Stock of the Company beneficially owned by each person believed by the
Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, by each incumbent director and nominee for director of the
Company, by each executive officer of the Company who was serving as such on
January 2, 1999 and by all current directors and executive officers of the
Company as a group. Except as indicated below, the Company understands that the
shareholders listed in such table have sole voting and investment power with
respect to the shares owned by them. The number of shares in the table below
includes shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options to the
extent that such options are exercisable by the shareholder, incumbent director,
nominee for director or executive officer on or within 60 days after February
28, 1999. In the case of each incumbent director, nominee for director and
executive officer, the information below has been provided by such person at the
request of the Company.

the discretion of the Board or its Executive Committee, the position may be left
vacant.

COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS

         The Board of Directors has an Executive Committee, an Audit and Finance
Committee, a Compensation and Human Resources Committee and a Nominating
Committee. The members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee also
constitute the members of the two committees which administer the Company's
employee stock option plans (collectively, the "Stock Option Committee"). During
fiscal year 1998, the Board of Directors held six meetings (including one by
telephone conference), the Executive Committee did not meet, the Audit and
Finance Committee held two meetings, the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee held four meetings (including two by telephone conference), the
Nominating Committee held one meeting and the Stock Option Committee did not
meet separately from the Compensation and Human Resources Committee. Each
director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the fiscal year 1998 meetings
of the Board of Directors and of the Board committee or committees on which he
or she served during the year.

         The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of the
Board of Directors, except action on dividends and certain other matters which
cannot by law be delegated by the Board, during the periods between regular
Board meetings. The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for recommending
to the Board the firm to be employed by the Company as its independent
accountants and auditors, consulting with such firm as to the annual audit and
the adequacy of internal controls, reviewing the accounting controls, practices
and policies of the Company and reviewing budgets, cash and debt management and
financial matters generally. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee
recommends to the Board the compensation of the Company's chief executive
officer, reviews and takes action on the chief executive officer's
recommendations regarding the appropriate compensation of the Company's other
officers and key personnel, approves the granting of any bonuses to officers,
reviews other compensation and personnel development matters generally and
recommends to the Board the compensation of non-employee directors. The
Nominating Committee's duties are to evaluate Board performance, recommend to
the Board nominees for election as directors and recommend to the Board the
membership of all


                                       5

Board committees. The Stock Option Committee is responsible for administering
the Company's 1996 Equity Compensation Plan and another stock option plan which
has expired (but under which there remain outstanding stock options).

         The current members of the Executive Committee are Messrs. Cloues
(Chairman), Beebe and Cohen; of the Audit and Finance Committee, Messrs. Pinola
(Chairman) and Wirth, Dr. Schurmann and Mrs. Sisco; of the Compensation and
Human Resources Committee, Messrs. Cohen (Chairman) and Pinola and Mrs. Sisco;
of the Nominating Committee, Messrs. Beebe (Chairman) and Cloues; and of the
Stock Option Committee, Messrs. Cohen and Pinola and Mrs. Sisco.

STANDARD COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

         Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual
retainer of $12,500, a $2,000 annual retainer for each membership on any of the
Audit and Finance Committee, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee and
the Nominating Committee, a $1,000 annual retainer for membership on the
Executive Committee, $1,000 for each Board meeting attended and $750 for each
Executive Committee meeting attended provided that, in the case of Executive
Committee meetings, such meetings either require substantial preparation or last
two hours or more. In addition, the chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee
and the chairman of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are each paid
an additional $1,500 for their service in such capacities. All retainers are
paid on a prorated bi-monthly basis. Directors generally do not receive
compensation for their participation in telephone meetings or for attendance at
other committee meetings. Under the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan, non-employee
directors are eligible to receive stock options and, unless the Stock Option
Committee determines otherwise (which has not been the case in the past), on the
date of each annual meeting of shareholders of the Company, each non-employee
director receives an annual stock option grant to purchase 1,000 shares of
Common Stock with an option price per share equal to the fair market value of a
share of Common Stock on that date. Such options are fully vested on the date of
grant and have a ten-year term.

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE

         Each non-employee director is required to own shares of Company Common
Stock with a value, at the greater of cost or market, equal to four times the
current $12,500 annual retainer, or $50,000. As for any newly-elected director,
this requirement will be phased in over a period of time to be determined by the
Board.

REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF NOMINATIONS

         Article Ninth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company provides that no person may be nominated for election as a director by a
shareholder at an annual or special meeting unless written notice of such
shareholder's intent to make such nomination has been given, either by personal
delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the
Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than (i)
with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, 90
days in advance of such meeting and (ii) with respect to an election to be held
at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the close of
business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting
is first given to shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name
and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the
person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the shareholder is
a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or
understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or
nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d) such other information
regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be
included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended
to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e) the consent of each nominee
to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. The chairman of the meeting
may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance
with the foregoing procedure.

CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

         Messrs. Weinberg, Bowen and Guenthardt were employed by the Company or
a subsidiary during fiscal year 1998 under employment agreements with the
Company (the "Employment Agreements"). Under these Employment Agreements,
Messrs. Weinberg, Bowen and Guenthardt are entitled to receive a base salary,
which may be increased from time to time, and such additional compensation and
bonus payments as may be awarded to them. During fiscal year 1998, the annual
base salaries for Messrs. Weinberg, Bowen and Guenthardt were $170,000, $150,000
and $150,000, respectively. (Mr. Guenthardt's base salary was converted into
Swiss francs at the $/Sfr. exchange rate in effect at the beginning of fiscal
year 1998 and was paid in Swiss francs through September 30, 1998, after which
it was paid in U.S. dollars.) As of the beginning of fiscal year 1999, Messrs.
Bowen's and Guenthardt's annual base salaries were increased to $165,000 each.
The Company's obligation to pay such base salaries is subject to its right to
reduce them in the event reductions are generally being made for other officers
of the Company or its subsidiaries holding comparable positions.

         Each of the Employment Agreements provides that either the Company or
the employee may terminate the employment term thereunder upon not less than one
year's prior notice. Such employment terms are also subject to termination by
reason of the employee's death or disability or by the Board of Directors at any
time for "cause" as specified in the Employment Agreements. In addition, the
Company has the right to terminate any of Messrs. Weinberg, Bowen or Guenthardt
at any time without cause by paying him a lump sum amount equal to 100% of his
then-annual base salary or, if the previously described one-year notice of
termination has already been given by the Company to him, the portion thereof
relating to the balance of the employment term.

         Mr. Cloues was employed by the Company during fiscal year 1998 under an
employment agreement with the Company pursuant to which he served as the
Company's Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. During
fiscal year 1998, Mr. Cloues received a base salary of $380,000, a bonus of
$285,000 and a restricted stock grant for 7,500 shares of Common Stock (which
restrictions lapsed on January 5, 1999). In addition, on January 5, 1999, Mr.
Cloues received a stock grant for 12,500 shares of Common Stock, of which 2,500
shares were unrestricted and 10,000 shares were restricted, with the restriction
to lapse on January 5, 2000



                                       10
<PAGE>   13
provided that Mr. Cloues is still employed by the Company on that date. The
foregoing stock grants were made in accordance with Mr. Cloues' employment
agreement. As of the beginning of fiscal year 1999, Mr. Cloues' annual base
salary was increased to $400,000.

         Mr. Cloues' employment agreement provides that he can terminate the
agreement upon not less than 90 days prior notice. The agreement also provides
that the Company may terminate the employment term thereunder without cause
effective at any time after January 8, 2001, but the Company must provide Mr.
Cloues with not less than two years prior notice of such termination. At Mr.
Cloues' election, he may then terminate the employment term ("Termination Event
One"). After January 8, 2001, the Company may terminate the employment term
without cause upon not less than 30 days prior written notice ("Termination
Event Two"). Upon the occurrence of Termination Event One or Two, Mr. Cloues
would be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to 200% of his then-annual base
salary. Mr. Cloues' employment term is also subject to termination by reason of
his death or disability or by the Board of Directors at any time for "cause" as
specified in his employment agreement.

         Mr. Cloues' employment agreement also includes provisions relating to a
termination of employment upon a "change of control" (as specified in his
employment agreement). Mr. Cloues' employment agreement applies to a termination
of employment upon or within one year after a "change in control" which, if such
termination was initiated by the Company or any successor thereto, was for any
reason other than death, disability or "cause" or which, if such termination was
initiated by Mr. Cloues, was at his sole discretion without regard to reason. In
the event of the termination of employment of Mr. Cloues upon a "change of
control," his employment agreement provides that, subject to certain
limitations, the Company would pay him (i) an amount equal to three times his
annual base salary in effect either immediately prior to the termination of
employment or immediately prior to the "change of control," whichever is higher
and (ii) unless Mr. Cloues notifies the Company in writing that he intends to
retain his options, an amount equal to the spread (the excess of market value
over exercise price) on any stock options then held by him, whether or not such
options were exercisable at the date of termination.


         NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, THE FOLLOWING REPORT OF THE
         COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND THE PERFORMANCE GRAPH ON
         PAGE 14 SHALL NOT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE BY ANY GENERAL
         STATEMENT INCORPORATING BY REFERENCE THIS PROXY STATEMENT INTO ANY
         FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR UNDER THE
         SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
         THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY INCORPORATES THIS INFORMATION BY REFERENCE,
         AND SHALL NOT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED FILED UNDER SUCH ACTS.

                           REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION
                          AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE

         As members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the
"Compensation Committee"), it is our duty to review the compensation paid to the
Named Executive Officers, to recommend to the Board the annual base salary of
the Company's Chief Executive Officer, to approve the annual base salaries of
the other Named Executive Officers and of all other officers of the Company and
to approve all bonuses and other material compensation granted to such persons.
In addition, we also constitute the committee (the "Stock Option Committee")
which administers the Company's 1996 Equity Compensation Plan and thus are
responsible for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock to officers and employees of the Company. These duties and the
other responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are more fully described on
page 5 of this Proxy Statement under the caption "Matters Concerning Directors -
Committees and Meetings." In fulfilling these duties and responsibilities, it is
the Compensation Committee's goal to have a policy that will enable the Company
to attract, retain and reward senior officers who contribute to both its
short-term and long-term success. The members of the Compensation Committee are
all non-employee, independent directors.



                                       11
<PAGE>   14
         The Company's compensation policy for senior officers is to pay
competitively and to be fair and equitable in the administration of pay. This is
the same policy applicable to all employees of the Company. The Company seeks to
balance the compensation paid to a particular individual with the compensation
paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside the Company
and at other similar companies.

         For fiscal year 1998, the Compensation Committee recommended and the
Board approved an incentive compensation program consisting of two parts, one
involving cash payments and the other the grant of stock options. Under this
program, no incentive compensation was earned until the Company's pre-tax budget
for 1998 was met; the incentive compensation pool was then filled until it
equaled 20% of pre-tax, pre-incentive compensation income. Thereafter, the
incentive compensation pool continued to increase by an amount equal to 20% of
all additional pre-tax, pre-incentive compensation income. The total incentive
compensation pool was then split approximately 50/50 between an identified group
of managers and all other employees, with specific awards dependent on both
overall corporate and local performance. All incentive compensation awards were
paid in cash, and, except for the Chief Executive Officer's award, each Named
Executive Officer's award was based on the Chief Executive Officer's
recommendation to the Compensation Committee. This recommendation was based on
the Chief Executive Officer's subjective judgment but took into account a number
of factors, including the performance of the unit for which such officer was
responsible, overall corporate results, teamwork, growth strategy implementation
and any special accomplishments of the individual in question. The amount of the
incentive compensation award to the Chief Executive Officer during fiscal year
1998 was determined by the Compensation Committee as described in the next
paragraph. With respect to stock options, up to 50,000 were eligible to be
granted under the program as a result of the Company achieving its objective of
15% earnings per share growth in fiscal year 1998. In the beginning of fiscal
year 1999, the members of the Compensation Committee, acting as the Stock Option
Committee, approved grants of non-qualified options to purchase 46,000 shares of
Common Stock, and all such grants were at market price on the grant date, vest
over four years from that date and have a life of ten years.

         Since the Company achieved its fiscal year 1998 pre-tax budget, bonuses
were paid under the program, including a $285,000 bonus to Edward B. Cloues, II,
the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Cloues' bonus was determined by the
Compensation Committee and reflected the Compensation Committee's recognition of
the key role played by Mr. Cloues during fiscal year 1998, including the
Company's achievement of record financial results as well as of certain key
non-financial objectives such as the centralization of its research and
development efforts. The awards made to the other three Named Executive Officers
of the Company were recommended by Mr. Cloues on the basis described in the
immediately preceding paragraph and approved by the Compensation Committee, and
they equaled $45,000 for Mr. Weinberg and $75,000 for each of Messrs. Bowen and
Guenthardt. None of these four Named Executive Officers received option grants
under the Company's 1998 incentive compensation program; however, as described
below, on July 16, 1998 each of Messrs. Bowen and Guenthardt was awarded an
incentive stock option to purchase 25,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $19.00 per share.

         For fiscal year 1999, the Compensation Committee has recommended and
the Board has approved an incentive compensation program that is substantially
similar to last year's program with respect to cash payments but does not
provide for the grant of stock options. It is expected that future stock options
will be granted by the Stock Option Committee on a case-by-case basis, as and
when deemed appropriate.

         As with respect to bonuses, the decisions of the Compensation Committee
regarding salaries are subjective and not based on any list of specific
criteria. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Edward B. Cloues, II, had a
1998 base salary of $380,000 as required by his employment agreement with the
Company. With respect to the Company's other executive officers, their annual
base salaries during fiscal year 1998 were as follows: Mr. Weinberg, $170,000;
Mr. Bowen, $150,000; and Mr. Guenthardt, $150,000. Effective at the beginning of
fiscal year 1999, Mr. Cloues' annual base salary was increased to $400,000, and
the annual base salaries for Messrs. Bowen and Guenthardt were increased to
$165,000 each. Mr. Weinberg's base salary was left unchanged. The Committee
accepted the Chief Executive Officer's salary recommendations for Messrs.
Bowen, Guenthardt and



                                       12
<PAGE>   15
Weinberg, which were based on many of the factors described above with respect
to incentive compensation awards. The same was also true of the factors which
the Committee took into account in determining the Chief Executive Officer's
1999 salary.

         As stated above, the members of the Compensation Committee also serve
as the members of the Stock Option Committee which administers the 1996 Equity
Compensation Plan providing for grants of stock options, stock appreciation
rights and restricted stock. The purpose of stock option grants is to provide an
additional incentive to key employees to work to maximize shareholder value, and
vesting periods may be utilized to encourage such employees to remain with the
Company. Stock option grants are entirely at the discretion of the Stock Option
Committee, including their timing, the recipients thereof and the number of
shares underlying any particular grant. In the beginning of fiscal year 1998,
non-qualified stock options for an aggregate of 49,000 shares were granted
pursuant to the Company's 1997 incentive compensation program, and non-qualified
stock options for an aggregate of 46,000 shares were granted in the beginning of
fiscal year 1999 pursuant to the Company's 1998 incentive compensation program
described above. Further, pursuant to Mr. Cloues' employment agreement, he
received on October 7, 1998 a restricted stock grant for 7,500 shares of Common
Stock under the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan, with the restriction lapsing on
January 5, 1999, and he also received on January 5, 1999 a stock grant for
12,500 shares of Common Stock under the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan, of which
2,500 shares were unrestricted and 10,000 shares were restricted, with the
restriction to lapse on January 5, 2000 provided that Mr. Cloues is still
employed by the Company on that date. In addition, in order to provide Messrs.
Bowen and Guenthardt with long term, company performance-related compensation,
the Stock Option Committee in July 1998 granted to each of them under the 1996
Equity Compensation Plan, incentive stock options to purchase 25,000 shares of
Common Stock that vest in five equal installments commencing on the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant. All stock option grants were at market price
on the date of grant.

         In summary, we believe that the combination of salary, bonus, stock
options and awards and other compensation received by each of the Named
Executive Officers for fiscal year 1998 was reasonable in view of their past and
anticipated future contributions to the Company.

         Payments during 1998 to the Company's executives as discussed above
were made with regard to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Section 162(m) limits the deduction that may be claimed by a
"public company" for compensation paid to certain individuals to $1 million
except to the extent that any excess compensation is "performance-based
compensation." It is the Compensation Committee's intention that as a general
rule compensation should not be limited as to its deductibility under Section
162(m).

         The following line graph compares the yearly change in the cumulative
total shareholder return on the Company's Common Stock for the past five fiscal
years with the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index
(the "S&P 500") and the Dow Jones Factory Equipment Industry Group, which is
described more fully below (the "Factory Equipment Group"). The graph assumes
that $100 was invested at the end of fiscal year 1993 in the Company's Common
Stock, the S&P 500 and the Factory Equipment Group. Dividend reinvestment has
been assumed and, with respect to companies in the Factory Equipment Group, the
returns of each such company have been weighted at each measurement point to
reflect relative stock market capitalization.

                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

         Arthur Andersen LLP has served as the Company's independent public
accountants and auditors since 1994. It is management's expectation that Arthur
Andersen LLP will continue in such capacity for the current year, but this
matter has not yet been considered by the Board of Directors. A representative
of Arthur Andersen LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the
opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and to be
available to respond to appropriate questions.


                  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS -- 2000 ANNUAL MEETING

         Shareholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for
shareholder action at annual meetings in accordance with regulations adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any proposal which an eligible
shareholder desires to have presented at the 2000 annual meeting of shareholders
(which is expected to be held on or about May 5, 2000) concerning a proper
subject for inclusion in the proxy statement and for consideration at the annual
meeting, will be included in the Company's proxy statement and related proxy
card if it is received by the Company no later than November 27, 1999.


             SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires that directors and certain officers of the Company, and persons who own
more than ten percent of the Company's Common Stock, file reports of ownership
of Company securities and changes in ownership of Company's securities with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that all filings
required to be made during fiscal year 1998 were made on a timely basis.


                                  OTHER MATTERS

         The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to bring any
other matters before the Annual Meeting and has no reason to believe any other
matters will be presented. If, however, other matters properly do come before
the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxy agents in the
enclosed Proxy Card to vote upon such matters in accordance with their judgment.
