                               GENERAL INFORMATION


INFORMATION ABOUT PROXY SOLICITATION

     This Proxy Statement is furnished to the holders of the common stock, $.01
par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Aceto Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company") in connection with the solicitation of proxies on
behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for use at the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders to be held on December 6, 2001 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard
Time), at the Company's offices, One Hollow Lane, Suite 201, Lake Success, New
York 11042, and at any adjournment thereof. The purposes of the meeting and the
matters to be acted upon are set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual
Meeting of Shareholders. At present, the Board of Directors knows of no other
business which will come before the meeting.

     The Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement, and form of proxy will be
mailed to Shareholders on or about October 25, 2001. The Company will bear the
cost of its solicitation of proxies. The original solicitation of proxies by
mail may be supplemented by personal interview, telephone, telegram, and telefax
by the directors, officers and employees of the Company. Arrangements will also
be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for
the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held
by such persons, and the Company may reimburse such custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
therewith.

REVOCABILITY AND VOTING OF PROXY

     A form of proxy for use at the meeting and a return envelope for the proxy
are enclosed. Shareholders may revoke their proxies at any time before being
voted. Shares of Common Stock represented by executed and unrevoked proxies will
be voted in accordance with the instructions specified thereon. If no
instructions are given, the proxies will be voted FOR the election of
management's seven nominees for election as directors; FOR the amendment to the
Company's 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan; and FOR ratification of the
appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 2002.

RECORD DATE AND VOTING RIGHTS

     Only stockholders of record at the close of business on September 14, 2001
are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.
On September 14, 2001, the Company had outstanding 6,514,507 shares of Common
Stock, each of which is entitled to one vote upon matters presented at the
meeting.

     Votes cast at the meeting will be tabulated by persons appointed as
inspectors of election of the meeting. The inspectors of election will treat
shares of Common Stock represented by a properly signed and returned proxy as
"present" at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, without regard to
whether the proxy is marked as casting a vote or abstaining. Likewise, the
inspectors of election will treat shares of Common Stock represented by "broker
non-votes" as present for purposes of determining a quorum.

     The nominees for election to the Board of Directors receiving the greatest
number of affirmative votes cast by the holders of Common Stock, up to the
number of directors to be elected, will be elected as directors. Accordingly,
abstentions or broker non-votes as to the election of directors will have no
effect on the election of directors.

     The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common
Stock represented at the meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at
the meeting will be required to approve the amendment to the Company's 1998
Omnibus Equity Award Plan, and to ratify the selection of independent public
auditors. In determining whether such proposals have received the requisite
number of affirmative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as votes against the proposal.

     A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be
available at the Company's office, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New York
11042, during business hours, for a period of 10 days prior to the Annual
Meeting for examination by any shareholder. Such list will also be available at
the Annual Meeting.

QUORUM

     The presence, either in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of
the shares of common stock outstanding on September 14, 2001 is necessary to
constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting.

(1)  The dollar value of each exercisable and unexercisable option was
     calculated by multiplying the number of shares of common stock underlying
     the option by the difference between the exercise price of the option and
     the closing price of the Company's common stock on June 29, 2001 ($10.02).

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         Directors of the Company who are not also employees receive $15,000 per
year for serving on the Board of Directors plus $500 for each committee meeting
attended. Directors of the Company who are also employees are not compensated
for their services as Directors.

         On October 25, 2000, the Company granted each of Messrs. Hendler,
Wiesen, and Fischer 1,000 non-qualified stock options pursuant to the 1998
Omnibus Equity Award Plan. Each option vests one year from the date of grant, is
exercisable at $9.75 and expires 10 years from the date of grant.

         In recognition of their election as directors of the Company, on
December 7, 2000, Messrs. Eilender and Schlesinger were also awarded 1,000
non-qualified stock options each. These options vest one year from the date of
grant, are exercisable at $9.125 and expire 10 years from the date of grant.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

The Company has no employment agreements with any of its senior executives.

LIMITS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

         The Company's Articles of Incorporation eliminate the personal
liability of its directors to the Company and its shareholders for monetary
damages for breach of the directors' fiduciary duties in certain circumstances.
The Articles of Incorporation further provide that the Company will indemnify
its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Company
believes that such indemnification covers at least negligence and gross
negligence on the part of the indemnified parties. Insofar as indemnification
for liabilities under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors,
officers, and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the

                                       8
<PAGE>

foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the
opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION.

         Members of the Executive Compensation Committee, with the exception of
Leonard S. Schwartz, have never served as officers or employees of the Company
or any of our subsidiaries. During the last fiscal year, none of our senior
executives served on the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of any
other entity whose officers served either on our Board of Directors or
Compensation Committee.

                 REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

         The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are
Leonard S. Schwartz (Chairman), Stanley H. Fischer, Samuel I. Hendler and Robert
A. Wiesen, functions as the Executive Compensation Committee, and makes
recommendations to the Board with respect to the remuneration of the Company's
executive officers.

         The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the
Company to attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and
abilities will contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum
profitability to the Company and its stockholders, by providing salaries and
benefits competitive with those offered by other companies in the chemical
industry. The executive compensation program includes base salary, annual
incentive compensation (cash bonuses), and long term incentive compensation
(awards under the Company's 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan).

         Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the chemical industry.
Because of the way the Company operates its business, the contributions of it
executives significantly affect corporate profitability. Bonuses (which can
exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such contributions. The
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) also is the Chairman of the Board, President and
Chief Operating Officer of the Company. The bonuses paid to the CEO and to the
Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), reflect the
Company's overall performance (excluding extraordinary events).

         The three highest paid executives, other than the CEO and CFO, are each
responsible for the performance of one of the Company's principal profit
centers. Internally generated performance records are kept on a monthly and
yearly basis for these profit centers, and each center's profitability is
compared in the current year to the previous year. Other factors considered in
determining the bonuses of individual executives are the individuals own
performance and the overall performance of the Company. The Executive
Compensation Committee determines each bonus primarily based on this data, also
taking into account the long term contributions of each individual.

         The CEO's compensation was determined on the basis of the same factors
utilized to compensate other executives, taking into consideration total
compensation comparisons of top executives of corporations considered to be in
the Company's peer group.

Committee

                          REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

         We operate in accordance with a written charter adopted by the Board of
Directors, a copy of which was disseminated to stockholders as Appendix 1 to the
Proxy Statement for the December 7, 2000, annual meeting of stockholders. We met
with KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), the independent auditors and with management, to review
the scope and results of the audit engagement, the system of internal controls
and procedures, and the effectiveness of procedures intended to prevent
violations of laws and regulations. We reviewed all services performed by KPMG
for the Company in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, within and outside the
scope of the quarterly reviews and annual auditing functions.

         We received the following information concerning the fees of the
independent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and considered
whether the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the
independence of the independent auditors:

              for advisory services related principally to tax consultation
              services, business consulting services and transaction support
              services.
</TABLE>

         We reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, with management, and discussed with KPMG the
matters required to be discussed by SAS 61(Codification of Statements on
Auditing Standards, AU Sec. 380) as amended. We also received the written
disclosures and letter from KPMG required by Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1, which letter states that they are independent accountants with
respect to the Company. We discussed with KPMG their independence. Based on our
review and discussions, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the
audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, for filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

         We have reviewed our charter and determined that it continues to state
appropriate guiding principles for us.

         Our committee is composed solely of members who are independent and
have the expertise to serve on the Audit Committee pursuant to all relevant
criteria including Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASD listing standards.

                                  PROPOSAL TWO



APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S 1998 OMNIBUS EQUITY AWARD PLAN TO INCREASE
THE NUMBER OF AWARDS AUTHORIZED TO BE GRANTED THEREUNDER FROM 500,000 TO
1,000,000 AND TO PERMIT THE GRANT OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS THEREUNDER.

         We are asking for your approval of an amendment to SECTION 4(a) of the
Aceto Corporation 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan (the "Plan") to provide that
the number of shares of our common stock with respect to which options,
restricted stock awards, or other stock based awards ("Awards") may be granted
under the Plan be increased from 500,000 to 1,000,000 and that SECTION 6 be
amended to permit the issuance of incentive stock options. The Board adopted
this amendment to the Plan, subject to your approval at the Annual Meeting.

         The Company's shareholders approved the Plan on December 10, 1998,
under which a total of 500,000 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment for
changes in our capitalization) were authorized for issuance. Of the 500,000
shares authorized only 180,000 shares are presently available for grants.


SUMMARY OF THE PLAN, AS AMENDED

         We summarize below certain key provisions of the Plan, as amended.
Because it is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is
important to you. Before you decide how to vote, you should review the full text
of the Plan, as amended, which we have included as Exhibit A.

          DESCRIPTION OF THE 1998 OMNIBUS EQUITY AWARD PLAN, AS AMENDED

PURPOSES AND ELIGIBILITY

         The purposes of the Omnibus Equity Award Plan are to attract, retain
and motivate eligible participants to compensate them for their contributions to
our growth and profits and to encourage them to own Aceto common stock. The
Omnibus Equity Award Plan authorizes the issuance of certain awards to such
individuals. Eligible participants are employees (including officers and
directors of the company or its affiliates), non-employee directors, advisors,
consultants or independent contractors to the Company or its affiliates.

SHARES AVAILABLE, OVERALL LIMIT

         A total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock will be authorized for
issuance under the Plan, as amended. (Prior to the amendment a total of 500,000
shares was authorized). We will adjust the number of shares available for
issuance under the Plan if there are changes in our capitalization, including
(but not limited to) stock dividends, stock splits, a merger, reorganization or
similar transactions. We may issue new shares or treasury shares or both.
Treasury shares are shares that we previously issued and subsequently
repurchased and are holding in our treasury.

                                       15
<PAGE>

ADMINISTRATION

         The Plan is administered by the Board. The Executive Committee of the
Board ("Committee") makes recommendations to the Board as to which participants
from among the eligible participants shall receive awards and determines the
form, terms and conditions of awards. The Board makes all awards under the Plan,
and has sole discretion with regard to any award.

AWARDS GENERALLY

         The Plan authorizes the following awards based upon Aceto common stock:
stock options; restricted stock; or other stock-based awards the Committee
determines to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan and the interests of
Aceto. The Board determines vesting, exercisability, payment and other
restrictions that apply to an award. Vesting means the individual has the right
to the award.

CHANGE IN CONTROL

         A change in control of Aceto (generally a merger or consolidation into
another company or a "person" becoming beneficial owner of 20% or more of
Aceto's voting stock without concurrence of the Board) will cause all
outstanding awards to vest, become immediately exercisable, and have all
restrictions lifted. (The change in control provision could be viewed as having
an anti-takeover consequence, in that it could have a deterrent effect against a
hostile takeover).

STOCK OPTIONS

         All stock options issued will be either incentive stock options or
non-qualified stock options. The exercise price per share shall be not less than
the fair market value of Aceto common stock on the date of grant and may not be
exercisable less than six months from the date it is granted. The exercise price
of a stock option may be paid in cash or previously owned stock or both.

          Under the Plan, options to purchase the Company's Common Stock may
take the form of incentive stock options ("ISOs") under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or non-qualified stock
options ("NQSOs"). As required by Section 422 of the Code, the aggregate fair
market value (as defined in the Plan) of shares of Common Stock (determined as
of the date of grant of the ISO) with respect to which ISOs granted to an
employee may not exceed $100,000 in any calendar year. The foregoing limitation
does not apply to NQSOs.

         Initially, each option will be exercisable over a period, determined by
the Board of Directors in its discretion, of up to ten years from the date of
grant. Options may be exercisable during the option period at such time, in such
amounts, and in accordance with such terms and conditions and subject to such
restrictions as are determined by the Board and set forth in option agreements
evidencing the grant of such options.



         The exercise price of options granted pursuant to the Plan is
determined by the Board, in its discretion; provided that the exercise price of
an ISO may not be less than 100% of the fair market value (as defined in the
Plan) of the shares of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant. The
exercise price of options granted pursuant to the Plan is subject to adjustment
as provided in the Plan to reflect stock dividends, splits, other

                                       16
<PAGE>

recapitalizations or reclassifications or changes in the market value of the
Company Common Stock. In addition, the Plan provides that, in the event of a
proposed change in control of the Company (as defined in the Plan), the Board is
to take such actions as it deems appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the
Plan and to protect the grantees of options, which action may include (i)
acceleration or change of the exercise dates of any option; (ii) arrangements
with grantees for the payment of appropriate consideration to them for the
cancellation and surrender of any option; and (iii) in any case where equity
securities other than Common Stock are proposed to be delivered in exchange for
or with respect to Common Stock, arrangements providing that any option shall
become one or more options with respect to such other equity securities.
Further, in the event the Company dissolves and liquidates (other than pursuant
to a plan of merger or reorganization), then notwithstanding any restrictions on
exercise set forth in the Plan or any grant agreement pursuant thereto (i) each
grantee shall have the right to exercise his option at any time up to ten days
prior to the effective date of such liquidation and dissolution; and (ii) the
Board may make arrangements with the grantees for the payment of appropriate
consideration to them for the cancellation and surrender of any option that is
so canceled or surrendered at any time up to ten days prior to the effective
date of such liquidation and dissolution. The Board also may establish a
different period (and different conditions) for such exercise, cancellation, or
surrender to avoid subjecting the grantee to liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act.

         The shares purchased upon the exercise of an option are to be paid for
by the optionee in cash (or cash equivalents acceptable to the Committee) or by
such other means as the Committee may prescribe.

         Except as permitted pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and
in any event in the case of an ISO, an option is not transferable except by will
or the laws of descent and distribution. In no case may the options be exercised
later than the expiration date specified in the option agreement.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

         Restricted Stock awards may be awarded to an eligible participant in
lieu of a portion of cash bonus earned by the participant. These restricted
shares will vest over a period of years as determined by the Board at the time
of grant and will not be transferable until vested. In addition, awards of
Restricted Stock may have a premium paid in additional shares when fully vested.
There may be other restrictions as the Board may determine.

OTHER OMNIBUS EQUITY AWARDS

         The Board upon recommendation of the Committee has the authority to
specify the terms and provisions of other forms of equity-based awards or
equity-related awards not described above which the Committee determines to be
consistent with the purposes of the Plan and the interests of Aceto.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES

         One of the objectives of the Plan is that certain designated employees
be stockholders. The Plan contains guidelines for stock ownership, to be
attained in five years, relative to the positions and base salaries of the
employees involved. Restricted Stock awards can be used to satisfy these
requirements.

TERMINATION

         No awards shall be made after ten years from the December 10, 1998,
date that the Plan was first approved by the Company's stockholders.

AMENDMENT

         We may amend or terminate the Plan at any time. However, we must obtain
stockholder approval to increase the maximum number of shares issuable or reduce
the exercise price of a stock option.

         Also, we may not amend or terminate the 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan
without an employee's consent if it would adversely affect an employee's rights
to previously-granted awards.


FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

         The following is a brief summary of certain Federal income tax aspects
of awards under the Plan based upon the Federal income tax laws in effect on the
date hereof. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not describe
state or local tax consequences.

         INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. An optionee will not realize taxable income
upon the grant of an ISO. In addition, an optionee will not realize taxable
income upon the exercise of an ISO, provided that such exercise occurs no later
than three months after the optionee's termination of employment with the
Company (one year in the event of a termination on account of disability).
However, an optionee's alternative minimum taxable income will be increased by
the amount that the fair market value of the shares acquired upon exercise of an
ISO, generally determined as of the date of exercise, exceeds the exercise price
of the option. If an optionee sells the shares of Common Stock acquired upon
exercise of an ISO, the tax consequences of the disposition depend upon whether
the disposition is qualifying or disqualifying. The disposition of the shares is
qualifying if made more than two years after the date the ISO was granted and
more than one year after the date the ISO was exercised. If the disposition of
the shares is qualifying, any excess of the sale price of the shares over the
exercise price of the ISO would be treated as long-term capital gain taxable to
the option holder at the time of the sale. If the disposition is not qualifying,
i.e., a disqualifying disposition, the excess of the fair market value of the
shares on the date the ISO was exercised over the exercise price would be
compensation income taxable to the optionee at the time of the disposition, and
any excess of the sale price of the shares over the fair market value of the
shares on the date the ISO was exercised would be capital gain.

         Unless an optionee engages in a disqualifying disposition, the Company
will not be entitled to a deduction with respect to an ISO. However, if an
optionee engages in a disqualifying disposition, the Company generally will be
entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of compensation income taxable to
the optionee.

         NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. An optionee will not realize taxable
income upon the grant of an NQSO. However, when the optionee exercises the NQSO,
the difference between the exercise price of the NQSO and the fair market value
of the shares acquired upon exercise of the NQSO on the date of exercise is
compensation income taxable to the optionee. The Company generally will be
entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of compensation income taxable to
the optionee.

SECTION 3.
ADMINISTRATION.

designation of Participants; (ii) the type or types of Awards to be granted to
an Eligible Participant; (iii) the number of Shares to be covered by Awards;
(iv) terms and conditions of Awards; and (v) unless otherwise expressly provided
in the Plan, designations, determination, interpretations, and suggested
decisions with respect to the Plan or any Award.

(B) AUTHORITY OF BOARD. All Awards under the Plan shall be made by the Board,
which shall have full authority to accept, reject or modify any recommendations
of the Committee. All designations, determinations, interpretations, and other
decisions under or with respect to the Plan or any Award shall be within the
sole discretion of the Board, may be made at any time and shall be final,
conclusive, and binding upon all Persons, including the Company, any Affiliate,
any Participant, any holder or beneficiary of any Award, and any stockholder.

SECTION 4.
SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS.

(A) SHARES AVAILABLE. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(b), the
number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan
shall be one million (1,000,000). If, after the effective date of the Plan, any
Shares covered by an Award granted under the Plan are forfeited, or if such an
Award terminates or is canceled without the delivery of shares, then the Shares
covered by such Award, or the number of Shares otherwise counted against the
aggregate number of Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted, to the
extent of any such, forfeiture, termination or cancellation, shall again become
Shares with respect to which Awards may be granted. In the event that any Option
or other Award granted hereunder is exercised through the delivery of Shares or
in the event that withholding tax liabilities arising from such Award are
satisfied by the withholding of Shares by the Company, the number of Shares
available for Awards under the Plan shall be increased by the number of Shares
so surrendered or withheld.

(B) ADJUSTMENTS. In the event that any dividend (other than regular dividends)
or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or
other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
repurchase, or exchange of Shares, or other similar corporate transaction or
event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to
prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended
to be made available under the Plan, then adjustment shall be made, in such
manner as shall be equitable, of (i) the number of Shares with

<PAGE>

respect to which Awards may be granted, (ii) the number of Shares subject to
outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant or exercise price with respect to any
Award, provided, that with respect to any Award no such adjustment shall be made
to the extent that such adjustment would be inconsistent with the Plan's meeting
the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, as from time to time amended.

(C) SOURCES OF SHARES DELIVERABLE UNDER AWARDS. Any Shares delivered pursuant to
an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares or
of treasury Shares.

SECTION 5.
ELIGIBILITY.

Any employee (including an officer, Executive Officer or director) of the
Company or any Affiliate, including any non-employee director, advisor,
consultant or independent contractor to the Company or any Affiliate, shall be
an Eligible Participant. To the extent the Board deems it necessary, appropriate
or desirable to comply with foreign law or practice and to further the purpose
of this Plan, the Board may, without amending this Plan, (i) establish rules
applicable to Awards granted to Participants who are foreign nationals, are
employed outside the United States, or both, including rules that differ from
those set forth in this Plan, and (ii) grant Awards to such Participants in
accordance with those rules.

SECTION 6.
STOCK OPTIONS - TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

All Options granted under the Plan shall be either Incentive Stock Options or
Non-qualified Stock Options and shall be evidenced by Award Agreements which
shall be subject to applicable provisions of the Plan and such other provisions
as they may contain including:

(A) PRICE. The exercise price per Share shall not be less than 100% of the Fair
Market Value of a Share on the date of Award.

(B) PERIOD. The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee may establish the
term of any Option award under the Plan, provided, however, that an Option shall
expire no later than 10 years from the date of Award, and may not be exercisable
less than six months from the date it is granted.

(C) TIME OF EXERCISE. The Board, upon recommendation of the Committee, may
establish installment exercise terms in Awards to Participants based on the
passage of time or otherwise, such that the Option becomes fully exercisable in
a series of cumulating portions, and may also establish other conditions of
exercise as it shall determine and may accelerate the exercisability of any
Option granted to a Participant under the Plan.

(D) PAYMENT. No Shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option
until payment in full of the option price in cash, or its equivalent, or by
exchanging Shares owned by the optionee (which are not the subject of any pledge
or other security interest), or by a combination of the foregoing, provided that
the combined value of all cash and cash equivalents and the Fair Market Value of
any such Shares so tendered to the Company as of the date of such tender is at
least equal to such option price.

(E) EXERCISE. An Option, or portion thereof, shall be exercised by delivery of a
written notice of exercise to the Company, and payment of the full price of the
Shares being exercised. A Participant shall not have any of the

<PAGE>

rights or privileges of the holder of Common Stock until such time as Shares of
Common Stock are issued or transferred to the Participant.

(F) RESTRICTIONS ON INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. The aggregate Fair Market Value
(determined as of the Grant Date) of shares of Common Stock with respect to
which all Incentive Stock Options first become exercisable by any grantee in any
calendar year under this or another plan of the Company and its Affiliates may
not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may be permitted from time to time
under Section 422 of the Code. To the extent that such aggregate Fair Market
Value shall exceed $100,000, or other applicable amount, such Options (taking
Options into account in the order in which they were granted) shall be treated
as non-qualified stock options. In such case, the corporation may designate the
shares of Common Stock that are to be treated as stock acquired pursuant to the
exercise of any Incentive Stock Option by issuing a separate certificate for
such shares and identifying the certificate as Incentive Stock Option shares in
the stock transfer records of the Company.

The exercise price of any Incentive Stock Option granted to a grantee who owns
(within the meaning of Section 422(b)(6) of the Code, after the application of
the attribution rules in Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the total
combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Corporation or its Parent
or Subsidiary corporations (within the meaning of Sections 422 and 424 of the
Code) shall be not less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock
on the grant date and the term of such Option shall not exceed five years.

(G) OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS. Options may contain such other provisions, not
inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine
appropriate from time to time. No Option shall be an Incentive Stock Option
unless so designated by the Committee at the time of grant or in the Grant
Agreement evidencing such Option.

SECTION 7.
RESTRICTED STOCK

(A) GRANT. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board, upon recommendation
of the Committee, shall have authority to determine the Participants to whom
Shares of Restricted Stock shall be granted, the number of Shares of Restricted
Stock to be granted to each Participant, and the other terms and conditions of
such Awards. Restricted Stock may be awarded to an Eligible Participant in lieu
of a portion, as determined by the Board, of any annual cash bonus earned by
such Participant, which will vest ratably over a period of years determined by
the Board on each anniversary of the date of Award. Such Restricted Stock so
awarded, as set forth in the Award Agreement may have a premium in Shares
greater than the portion of the bonus to be paid in Restricted Shares, which
Premium shares shall be delivered to the Participant when the Award is fully
vested, provided that the Participant is in the employ of the Company when
vesting occurs.

(B) TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. Upon the lapse of the restrictions applicable to
Shares of Restricted Stock, the Company shall deliver certificates for same to
the Participant or the Participant's legal representative.

(C) PAYMENT. Each share of Restricted Stock shall be paid in Shares, upon the
lapse of the restrictions applicable thereto, or otherwise in accordance with
the applicable Award Agreement.

(D) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. Dividends and other distributions paid on or in
respect of any Shares of Restricted Stock shall be paid to the Participant.

<PAGE>

SECTION 8.
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

The following provisions shall apply in the event of the Participant's
termination of employment unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement:

(A) NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS.

(I) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. If the Participant's employment with the Company
or its Affiliates is terminated for any reason other than death, permanent and
total disability, or retirement, the Participant's right to exercise any Option
shall terminate, and such Option shall expire, on the earlier of (A) the first
anniversary of such termination of employment or (B) the date of such Option
would have expired had it not been for the termination of employment. The
Participant shall have the right to exercise such option prior to such
expiration to the extent it was exercisable at the date of such termination of
employment and shall not have been exercised.

(II) DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT. If the Participant's employment with the
Company or its Affiliates is terminated by death, permanent and total
disability, or retirement, the Participant or his or her estate representative
(if employment is terminated by death) shall have the right, within three (3)
months from the date of determination of permanent and total disability,
retirement, or the appointment of an estate representative, to exercise any
Option to the extent it was exercisable at the date of such termination of
employment and shall not have been exercised, but in no event shall such option
be exercisable later than the date the Option would have expired had it not been
for the termination of such employment.

(B) RESTRICTED STOCK. In the event of a Participant's retirement, permanent and
total disability, or death, or in cases of special circumstances, the Board may,
when it finds that a waiver would be in the best interest of the Company, waive
in whole or in part, any or all remaining restrictions with respect to such
Participant's entitlement to shares of Restricted Stock. In the event of a
Participant's death while in the employ of the Company, any or all remaining
restrictions with respect to such Participant's entitlement to shares of
Restricted Stock shall be deemed waived by the Board.

SECTION 9.
CHANGE IN CONTROL.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, upon a Change
in Control all outstanding Awards shall vest, become immediately exercisable or
payable and have all restrictions lifted as may apply to the type of Award.

SECTION 10.
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.

(A) AMENDMENTS TO THE PLAN. The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or
terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided that no such
amendment, alteration, suspension discontinuation or termination shall be made
without stockholder approval to: increase the number of shares issuable; reduce
the exercise price of Options or extend the termination period of the Plan. The
Board, however, may not amend or terminate the Plan without a Participant's
consent insofar as it would adversely affect a Participant's rights to
previously granted Awards.

<PAGE>

(B) CANCELLATION. Any Award granted hereunder may be canceled with the approval
and agreement of the Participant in consideration of a cash payment or
alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to
the Fair Market Value of such canceled Award.

SECTION 11.
GENERAL PROVISIONS

(A) NONTRANSFERABILITY. No Award shall be assigned, alienated, pledged,
attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant, except
by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a QDRO.

(B) NO RIGHTS TO AWARDS. No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to
be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of
Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions of
Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.

(C) SHARE CERTIFICATES. All certificates for Shares or other securities of the
Company delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof
shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the
Board may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon
which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable
Federal or state laws, and a legend or legends may be put on any such
certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

(D) WITHHOLDING. A Participant may be required to pay to the Company and the
Company shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold from any
Award, from any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan
or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in
cash, or Shares), of any applicable withholding taxes in respect of an Award,
its exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the Plan and to
take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to
satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes.

(E) AWARD AGREEMENTS. Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an Award
Agreement that shall be delivered to the Participant and shall specify the terms
and conditions of the Award and any rules applicable thereto.

(F) NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT. The grant of an Award shall not be construed as
giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or
any Affiliate. Further, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a
Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the
Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.

(G) RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. No holder of an Award of stock options or beneficiary
of any such Award shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to such
options until he or she has exercised such option and become the holder of
Shares. In connection with each grant of Restricted Stock hereunder, the
applicable Award shall be entitled to the rights of a stockholder in respect of
such Restricted Stock, except for such transfer restrictions as may be
applicable thereto.

(H) GOVERNING LAW. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any
rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be
determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

<PAGE>

(I) SEVERABILITY. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is
deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any
Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any applicable
law, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the
applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the
determination of the Board, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the
Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award
and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and
effect.

(J) OTHER LAWS. The Company may refuse to issue or transfer any Shares or other
consideration under an Award if, it determines that the issuance or transfer of
such shares might violate any applicable law or regulation or entitle the
Company to recover the same under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and any
payment tendered to the Company by a Participant, other holder or beneficiary in
connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly refunded to the
relevant Participant, holder, or beneficiary. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no Award granted hereunder shall be construed as an offer to sell
securities of the Company, and no such offer shall be outstanding, unless the
Board has determined that any such offer, if made, would be in compliance with
all applicable requirements of the U.S. federal securities laws any other laws
to which such offer, if made, would be subject.

(K) NO TRUST FUND CREATED. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be
construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the
