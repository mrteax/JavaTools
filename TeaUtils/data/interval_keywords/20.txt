PROXY STATEMENT

ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
October 11, 1995

SOLICITATION

This Proxy Statement is furnished to stockholders of AAR CORP., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company" or "AAR"), in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company to be used at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held in the Shareholders' Room
(21st Floor) of Bank of America Illinois, 231 S. LaSalle Street, Chicago,
Illinois, on Wednesday, October 11, 1995, at 3:00 P.M. (Chicago time), or any
adjournment thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement is first being
sent to stockholders on or about August 28, 1995.

Any proxy solicited herewith may be revoked by a stockholder at any time prior
to the voting thereof by sending written notice of revocation to the Secretary
of the Company, or by delivering a later-dated proxy, or by attending the Annual
Meeting and voting in person. Shares of Common Stock represented by proxies that
are properly executed and returned to the Company will be voted as specified
thereon at the Annual Meeting. If no choice is specified, such shares will be
voted FOR the election of the three nominees for director designated by the
Board of Directors, and upon any other matters that may properly come before the
Annual Meeting in the discretion of the named proxies in accordance with their
best judgment. In the event any nominee is unavailable for election, which is
not presently anticipated, shares represented by valid proxies will be voted for
such other person or persons in the named proxies in accordance with their best
judgment.

As provided in the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan, shares held by the Dividend Reinvestment Agent for a participant will be
voted in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card received
representing such shares or otherwise as set forth above.

The cost of the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company and will
consist primarily of printing, postage and handling, including reimbursement to
banks, brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy material to their respective
principals. The Company has engaged D. F. King & Co., 77 Water Street, New York,
New York, to aid in the solicitation of proxies at a total estimated cost of
$7,500.00. D. F. King & Co. may solicit proxies by mail, personally, or by
telephone or telegraph. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by D. F. King
& Co. and by use of the mails, certain officers, directors and employees of the
Company may solicit proxies personally, or by telephone or telegraph, without
additional compensation.

QUORUM AND VOTING RIGHTS

At the close of business on August 14, 1995, the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, there were
outstanding 15,964,300 shares of common stock of the Company, $1.00 par value
("Common Stock"). Each stockholder of record is entitled to one vote for every
share held on the record date. Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting
unless the

                                       1
<PAGE>
owner thereof is present in person or by proxy. A quorum of stockholders is
necessary to take action at the Annual Meeting. The holders of a majority of the
shares of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by
proxy will constitute a quorum of stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Votes cast
in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors
of election appointed for the Annual Meeting. The inspectors of election will
treat abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are present and entitled
to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a matter has been
approved.

                                   PROPOSAL 1

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company provide

directors, with the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time by
the Board of Directors, and that the directors shall be divided into three
classes as nearly equal in number as possible. The Board of Directors has fixed
the number of directors on the Board at ten.

The ten members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes: Class
I (3 directors), Class II (3 directors) and Class III (4 directors). Class II,
to be elected at this Annual Meeting, will consist of three directors who are to
serve for a three-year term until the 1998 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board of Directors
has designated Messrs. Edgar D. Jannotta, Lee B. Stern, and Richard D. Tabery as

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

Based solely upon a review of Securities and Exchange Commission Forms 3, 4 and
5 and upon related written representations furnished to the Company with respect
to its most recent fiscal year, no person who, at any time during the fiscal
year, was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of
any class of equity securities of the Company registered pursuant to Section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), failed to file on a
timely basis, as disclosed in the above Forms, reports required by Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year or prior fiscal years.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

GENERAL

The Company's executive compensation program is structured and administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), which is
comprised of the five individuals listed below, all of whom are independent,
outside directors of the Company.

The executive compensation program is designed to enable the Company to attract,
motivate and retain talented executives capable of achieving strategic business
initiatives and to reward them for their achievement. It is intended to
complement the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives and to
focus executives' efforts on fulfilling these objectives. The program consists
of three elements: (i) base salaries which are generally set at approximately
the median salary level of comparable positions in similar companies, adjusted
up or down to reflect individual capabilities and responsibilities and
experience levels; (ii) annual variable incentive opportunities paid in cash and
stock based on individual contribution and performance; and (iii) long-term
incentive opportunities, which include a stock option/restricted stock plan.

Total compensation opportunities for each executive are intended to be
competitive with those offered by other companies competing for their talent in
the Company's employment market. In designing and administering the individual
elements of the executive compensation program for each executive, the Committee
strives to balance short- and long-term incentive objectives and employ prudent
judgment in establishing base salary levels and performance criteria, evaluating
performance and determining actual incentive payments. To ensure competitiveness
and reasonableness of the Committee's compensation decisions, independent
compensation consulting firms are retained periodically to advise the Committee
in connection with both the design and implementation of the various elements of
the program and the level of individual executive participation. Generally, as
an executive's level of responsibility increases, a greater percentage of total
compensation is based on performance, and the mix of total compensation shifts
toward stock, thereby aligning the long-term interest of senior executives with
those of stockholders. To encourage stock ownership in the Company by senior
executives, thereby aligning their long-term interest with stockholders, the
Company has also established guidelines for ownership of Company stock by senior
management equal in value to 75% of salary, to be voluntarily achieved over the
next several years. An executive's progress towards achieving these guidelines
will be used by the Committee in making incentive stock compensation decisions
for the executive in the future.

Base salary levels of all executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, are
reviewed annually and may be adjusted depending upon the executive's
responsibilities, assessed performance contribution, qualifications and tenure
in the Company and in the position held, and competitive salary considerations
relative to similar positions at selected companies in the employment market
from which the Company draws its executives.

The Chief Executive Officer has an annual performance-based incentive
opportunity of 0-80% of base salary with 10% of the incentive bonus opportunity
payable in restricted stock. The Chief

                                       7
<PAGE>
Operating Officer has an annual performance-based incentive bonus opportunity of
up to 100% of base salary with that portion of the incentive bonus opportunity
in excess of 80% of base salary and 10% of the incentive bonus opportunity below
80% of base salary payable in restricted stock. The percentage opportunity for
other executive positions varies depending on their responsibility level, and
10% of any bonus paid is payable in restricted stock. As pertains to the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, three-fourths of their incentive
opportunity is based upon operating profit results and the remainder is based on
asset management results. Performance objectives for other executives are
established annually and the incentive opportunity varies depending on position.

The long-term incentive program consists of stock option and/or restricted stock
awards granted under the Company's Stock Benefit Plan approved by stockholders
in 1992.

Stock option awards typically expire 10 years from the date of grant or earlier
upon termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on
successive grant anniversary dates at the NYSE closing stock price on the date
of grant, and are accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals,
stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company. In
determining stock option and restricted stock awards, the Compensation Committee
considers the recipient's position and responsibilities in the Company,
performance and contributions made during the preceeding year, capabilities and
potential for future contribution to the Company, the number of options
previously granted to the recipient and, for senior management, their progress
toward achieving the Company's guidelines for stock ownership by senior
management.

Restrictions imposed on restricted stock awards vary and are designed, among
other things, to encourage executives to stay with the Company and to maintain a
focus on long-term objectives of the Company. Typically, restricted stock grants
vest over five (5) years (20% each anniversary) or over seven (7) years (25% on
4th anniversary, 25% on 6th anniversary and 50% on 7th anniversary); restricted
stock used in lieu of cash to pay earned bonuses vests over three (3) years (1/3
each anniversary). Typically, awards are subject to forfeiture if employment
terminates for any reason during the award cycle. During the award cycle the
participant receives dividends for the shares and also has the right to vote the
awarded shares.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

The base salary level of the Chief Executive Officer and founder of the Company
has been increased progressively since 1951 to reflect his performance,
leadership and responsibilities for increasingly complex and diversified
domestic and international operations as the Company has expanded into new
product lines and markets. Competitive compensation analyses by independent
consultants are used by the Committee to ensure that the Chief Executive
Officer's base salary is at an appropriate competitive level relative to base
salaries of chief executive officers at other companies in the relevant
employment market.

The Committee's action with respect to the Chief Executive Officer's total
fiscal year 1995 compensation reflects consideration of the base salary factors
discussed earlier, and the leadership role he played in the performance results
of the Company overall in a difficult environment and in maintaining the
financial strength and liquidity of the Company.

        - The Chief Executive Officer's base salary was increased 3% on
          January 1, 1995, as were management salaries generally.

        - The Chief Executive Officer was awarded an incentive bonus
          equal to 55.2% of his base salary reflecting achievement of (i)
          a 35.2% incentive opportunity benefit for operating performance
          based on a substantial improvement over the prior year in
          consolidated net sales (up 10.7%) and in net income (up 10.2%),
          and (ii) a 20% incentive opportunity benefit for asset
          management based on improving the balance sheet performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>
        - The Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers
          named in the Summary Compensation Table below received the
          stock options and restricted stock awards reflected in the
          table. The number of shares covered by each grant reflects
          individual contributions and performance, as well as
          competitive industry practices, in the view of the Committee;
          it also continues the Committee's emphasis on executive share
          ownership and furthers the Company's objective of tying
          incentive compensation to performance and aligning executives'
          interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders.

The tables which follow and accompanying footnotes and narrative reflect the
decisions covered by the above discussion.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The Internal Revenue Code places a $1 million cap on the deductibility of
compensation, subject to certain exceptions, paid to certain executives of
publicly held corporations. Since the current levels of compensation subject to
the cap will not exceed $1 million for any executives of the Company, the
Committee did not take into consideration the deductibility of compensation for
federal income tax purposes in establishing compensation of the named executives
during the present review cycle.

The Committee will continue to review the deductibility of Compensation under
Section 162(m) and any regulations adopted under it, with the goal of assuring
that compensation paid is deductible by the Company to the extent that this can
be reasonably accomplished in a manner that provides adequate incentives and
allows the Company to attract and retain qualified executives.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

This report of the Compensation Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by
reference by any general statement incorporating this Proxy Statement into any
filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 or under the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "Acts"), except to the extent that the Company specifically
incorporates this report by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed
under such Acts.

STOCK OPTIONS

The following table sets forth certain information regarding stock options
granted to the named executive officers in fiscal 1995 (the Company does not
grant stock appreciation rights). In addition, hypothetical gains or "option
spreads" that would exist for the respective options are shown based on assumed
rates of annual compound stock price appreciation of 0%, 5% and 10% required (in
the case of the 5% and 10% rates) by applicable regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission; these rates are for illustration purposes only and are
not a forecast of future

appreciation. The Company did not use an alternative formula for a grant date
valuation, as the Company is not aware of any formula which will determine, with
reasonable accuracy, a present value based on future unknown or volatile
factors.

</TABLE>

The Company's Retirement Plan covers all named executive officers. Benefits
under the Retirement Plan are determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the
Retirement Plan and take into consideration years of credited service, a
percentage of the participant's final average compensation (the five highest
consecutive calendar years of compensation out of the employee's last ten
calendar years of employment) and adjustments for social security "covered
compensation" which is an "offset" under the Retirement Plan. The term
"compensation" means cash compensation shown as income on an employee's Form
W-2, plus amounts contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan and reduced by certain
items specified in the Retirement Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
compensation for purposes of the Retirement Plan is subject to an annual
$150,000 annual compensation limitation in accordance with applicable provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code.

The aggregate salary and bonus compensation shown for the executive officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table above is the compensation currently
included for purposes of determining benefits under the Retirement Plan and
SKERP described below. The number of years of credited service under the Plan
(effective maximum is 20 years), is as follows: Mr. Eichner, 20 years; Mr.
Storch, 17 years; Mr. Pulsifer, 8 years; Mr. Romenesko, 14 years; and Mr.
Slapke, 11 years. Benefits under the Retirement Plan may be limited by
applicable laws or regulations.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company also provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain executives
and key employees under a Supplemental Key Employee Retirement Plan ("SKERP").
All of the named executives are participants in the SKERP except that Mr.
Eichner's participation does not include supplemental retirement benefits. The
SKERP is designed to restore the approximate amount of employer-provided
benefits under the Company's Retirement Plan lost as a result of Internal
Revenue Code limitations, including those limiting compensation for purposes of
benefit calculations. Such lost benefits restored under the SKERP are determined
in the same manner, using the same compensation data and years of credited
service, as retirement benefits are determined under the Company's Retirement
Plan described above, subject to maximum compensation limits established by the
Company from time to time (presently $335,000 for key employee participants

                                       12
<PAGE>
and $500,000 for executive officer participants). The SKERP also provides for
aggregate retirement benefits at fifty percent (50%) of final average
compensation (as defined in the Retirement Plan) for certain executive officers
designated by the Compensation Committee (including three of the named executive
officers), subject to maximum compensation limits established by the Company
from time to time and reduced by certain items specified in the Retirement Plan.
The SKERP is unfunded and supplemental retirement benefits thereunder are
forfeited if the participant violates a covenant not to compete set forth in the
SKERP or his or her employment is terminated for cause.

The Chief Executive Officer is also the beneficiary of a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan ("SERP"). Annual retirement benefits under the SERP are equal to
60% of the Chief Executive Officer's aggregate average of annual salary, bonus
and long-term incentive cash payments ("cash compensation") for the three fiscal
years during the ten fiscal years preceding the date of his termination of
active employment during which his cash compensation was highest, subject to an
offset for benefits received under the Retirement Plan and certain reductions.
Based on the Chief Executive Officer's cash compensation history to date, it is
estimated that he would receive an annual retirement benefit of $403,145.96
under the SERP upon retirement at age 65. In the case of his "involuntary
retirement" prior to age 65, the Chief Executive Officer is entitled to receive
his base salary for the three years following termination and, thereafter, to
receive the retirement benefits described above. "Involuntary retirement" means
termination of the Chief Executive Officer's employment by action of the Company
(other than due to disability), or a voluntary termination of his employment
within two years following a takeover of the Company. The Company funds the
benefits through an irrevocable trust arrangement with a bank. The level of
funding is based on actuarial computations determined by an independent actuary.
The residual in the trust upon the death of the Chief Executive Officer will be
paid to the Chief Executive Officer's estate or designated beneficiaries.

Mr. Eichner has an agreement with the Company providing for employment in his
present capacity at a base compensation of $488,000 per year, effective January

subject to certain reductions.

The Company has entered into an irrevocable trust agreement with The Northern
Trust Company as trustee to fund at certain dates the Company's obligations to
Mr. Eichner and his widow or other beneficiary under his employment agreement.
The Company will pay bonuses to Mr. Eichner (or his widow or other beneficiary)
to provide for federal, state and local income taxes incurred as a result of

estate or designated beneficiary(ies) will receive any residual amounts in the
trust after payment of all retirement, death benefit and other obligations under
the trust agreement.

The Company has entered into an employment agreement ("Employment Agreement")

continuously extended so as to have a remaining term of three years, but shall
expire upon his death, disability, retirement or termination by the Company or
Mr. Storch pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement.

The Employment Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Mr. Storch's
employment, including confidentiality and non-compete provisions, participation
in the Company's benefit plans, a severance payment upon termination of
employment by Company for other than cause (as defined in the Agreement) prior
to a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Employment Agreement)
equal to two times base salary then in effect, a severance payment equal to
three (3) times his average cash compensation (base salary plus cash bonus) for
the last two fiscal years of employment upon termination of employment under

restricted common stock vesting 20%/year on successive grant date anniversaries
and stock options for 60,000 shares of Company common stock under the Company's
Stock Benefit Plan.

The Company has entered into severance agreements with certain key employees,
including all named executive officers other than Mr. Storch and Mr. Eichner.
The severance agreements are substantially identical, include confidentiality
and non-compete covenants, and provide for payment of compensation and certain
benefits in consideration thereof in the event of termination of employment for
other than cause, including a change in control of the Company.

Severance equal to one year base salary plus any earned incentive cash bonus
will be paid upon termination of employment for other than cause (as defined in
the severance agreement) prior to a change in control of the Company; severance
equal to three times average annual total compensation (base salary plus cash
bonus) for the last two fiscal years of employment will be paid upon termination

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary
each receive an annual retainer of $22,000, a fee of $1,500 for attendance at
each meeting of the Board or of any Board committee and reimbursement of
expenses. The chairman of each committee receives an additional $1,500 annual
retainer. The Company also provides each of its outside directors with group
term life insurance coverage of $200,000. In addition, under the AAR CORP. Stock
Benefit Plan, each outside director, upon becoming a director, automatically
receives stock options for 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock which can
be exercised in 25% increments each anniversary grant date at the closing NYSE
price on the date of grant. Directors who are officers or employees of the
Company or any subsidiary receive no additional compensation for service on the
Board of Directors or any of its committees.

The Company also has a Directors' Retirement Plan for its outside directors. The
Plan provides for a benefit to outside directors upon retirement on or after age
65, provided they have completed at least five years of service as a director.
Benefits are payable as a quarterly annuity in an amount equal to 25% of the
annual retainer fee payable by the Company to an active outside director.
Payment of benefits commences upon retirement and continues for a period equal
to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a director to
a maximum of ten years or death, whichever first occurs. The Directors'
Retirement Plan is unfunded. As of May 31, 1995, one former director was
