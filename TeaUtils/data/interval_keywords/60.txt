                               PROXY STATEMENT

          The following information is furnished in connection with the 
solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company for the 
annual meeting of shareholders to be held on Wednesday, August 20, 1997, at 
4:00 P.M., Atlanta time, in the Ascot Room of the Renaissance Waverly Hotel, 
2450 Galleria Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia. A copy of the Company's annual 
report for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1997, and a proxy for use at the 
meeting are enclosed with this proxy statement. This proxy statement and the 
enclosed proxy were first mailed to shareholders on or about July 18, 1997.

                             GENERAL INFORMATION

          Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked, 
without compliance with any other formalities, by any shareholder who attends 
the meeting and gives oral notice of his or her election to vote in person. 
In addition, any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked 
prior to the meeting by delivering to the President of the Company a notice 
of revocation or a duly executed proxy for the same shares bearing a later 
date. All proxies of shareholders solicited by the Company which are properly 
executed and received by the President of the Company prior to the meeting, 
and which are not revoked, will be voted at the meeting. The shares 
represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions
thereon, and unless specifically instructed to vote otherwise, the 
individuals named in the enclosed proxy will vote to elect all the nominees 
as set forth in this proxy statement. Abstentions and broker non-votes will 
be included in determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, 
but will otherwise have no effect on the election of the nominees for 
Director. For purposes of determining approval of a matter presented at the
meeting other than the election of directors, abstentions will be deemed 
present and entitled to vote and will, therefore, have the same legal effect 
as a vote "against" a matter presented at the meeting. Broker non-votes will 
be deemed not entitled to vote on the subject matter as to which the non-vote 
is indicated and will, therefore, have no legal effect on the vote on that 
particular matter. A system administered by the Company's transfer agent will 
tabulate the votes cast.

          The cost of soliciting proxies is paid by the Company. Copies of 
solicitation material may be furnished to banks, brokerage houses and other 
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding to beneficial owners of 
shares of the Company's common stock, $1.00 par value per share (the "Common 
Stock"), and normal handling charges may be paid for such forwarding service. 
In addition to soliciting by mail, Directors and regular employees of the 
Company, at no additional compensation, may assist in soliciting proxies by 
telephone or other means.

          As of July 14, 1997, the record date for the annual meeting, there
were 2,942,356 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. The 
holders of Common Stock, the only class of voting stock of the Company 
outstanding, are entitled to one vote per share.


                                     1<PAGE>
NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

          The Board of Directors recommends the election of the nine (9) 
nominees listed below to constitute the entire Board to hold office until the 
next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are elected 
and qualified. If, at the time of the annual meeting, any of such nominees 
should be unable to serve, the persons named in the proxy will vote for such 
substitutes or vote to reduce the number of Directors for the ensuing year as 
management recommends. Management has no reason to believe that any 
substitute nominee or nominees or reduction in the number of Directors for 
the ensuing year will be required. The affirmative vote of a plurality of the 
votes cast is required to elect the nominees.

          The Company's By-Laws contain an advance notice procedure for the 
nomination of candidates for election to the Board. Notice of proposed 
shareholder nominations for election of directors must be given to the 
Secretary of the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to 
the meeting at which directors are to be elected, unless the notice of 
meeting is given less than 60 days prior to the meeting, in which case the 
notice of nomination must be received not later than the 10th day following
the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed to shareholders.
The notice of nomination must contain information about each proposed
nominee, including age, address, principal occupation, the number of shares
of stock of the Company beneficially owned by such nominee and such other
information as would be required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), in connection with any acquisition of
shares by such nominee or with the solicitation of proxies by such nominee for
his election as a director. Information must also be disclosed by and about
the shareholder proposing to nominate that person. The chairman of a
shareholder meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person
not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

          All of the nominees are now Directors of the Company
and have served continuously since their first election. The following
information relating to: (1) age as of August 20, 1997; (2) directorships in
other publicly-held companies; (3) positions with the Company; (4)
principal employment; and (5) Common Stock beneficially owned as of June
30, 1997, has been furnished by the respective nominees. Except as otherwise
indicated, each nominee has been or was engaged in his present or last
principal employment, in the same or a similar position, for more than five
years.

                      COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
                              REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

          The objectives of the Company's compensation program
are to enhance the profitability of the Company, and thus shareholder
value, by aligning  compensation with business goals and performance and
attracting, retaining and rewarding Executive Officers who contribute to
the long-term success of the Company. In furtherance of these goals, the
Company's compensation program for Executive Officers includes base
salary and annual bonus. In addition, at the discretion of the Board of
Directors, selected Executive Officers may participate in the Senior
Management Deferral Plan, which is designed to permit eligible employees
to defer a portion of their incentive compensation. The Compensation
Committee reviews and approves the compensation of the Company's
Executive Officers. 

          SALARY. The Compensation Committee determines the base
salary for the Executive Officers, including the CEO, based upon the
financial performance (including profitability and/or revenues) of the
Company or subsidiary, as the case may be, and upon the individual's
level of responsibility, time with the Company, contribution and
performance. Evaluation of these factors is subjective, and no fixed,
relative weights are assigned to the criteria considered. The beginning
point for determining the salary is the base salary the Executive Officer
received in the prior fiscal year.

          BONUS. The majority of the Bonuses and All Other Compensation 
reported in the Summary Compensation Table was paid pursuant to the
Company's profit-sharing plan. In general, all employees meeting certain
service requirements are eligible to participate in this plan. The
aggregate contribution of the Company is set annually by the Board of
Directors and then allocated based on the eligible compensation of
participants. As a result, profit-sharing plan allocations are based on
the same factors as are the salaries of the Executive Officers. 

          The Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of
Directors of a subsidiary company, as the case may be, determines the
amount of an annual cash bonus, separate from the profit-sharing plan,
for certain of the Executive Officers. These bonuses are based upon the
financial performance (including profitability and/or revenues) of the
Company or subsidiary, as the case may be, and upon the individual's
level of responsibility, time with the Company, contribution and
performance. During the most recently completed fiscal year, neither the
CEO nor the President received any such annual cash bonus.

          The Company does not anticipate that the law that
serves to cap executive compensation that is deductible by the Company at
$1,000,000 will have any impact on the compensation policies of the
Company.

          The tables included in the proxy statement and accompanying 
narrative and footnotes, reflect the decisions covered by the above 
discussion. The foregoing report has been furnished by the members of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors: Paula Lawton Bevington,
Richard H. Danielson, Donald W. MacLeod, L. Anthony Montag, Felker W.
Ward, Jr.

                         DIRECTORS COMPENSATION

          Each Director is paid a retainer of $550 per month and
a fee of $1,200 per Board of Directors meeting attended. In addition,
Directors who are members of the Audit Committee, but who are not
Officers of the Company, are paid a fee of $600 for each Audit Committee
meeting attended.

          DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. The Company maintains a 
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") 
under which members of the Board of Directors of the Company may elect to
defer to a future date receipt of all or any part of their compensation
as Directors and/or as members of a committee of the Board. For
purposes of the Deferred Compensation Plan, "compensation" means the
retainer fees and meeting fees payable to such Directors by the 

                               8<PAGE>
          Company in their capacities as Directors or as members
of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

          The Deferred Compensation Plan is administered by the
Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. A committee member may not
participate in any decision relating in any way to his individual rights
or obligations as a participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

           The Company will make payments of deferred compensation and
the earnings on such deferred compensation under the Deferred
Compensation Plan at the time specified by each participant in a lump sum
or, at the sole discretion of the participant, in no more than five equal
annual installments. For the year ended April 30, 1997, five members of
the Board of Directors (including two Executive Officers who are also
Directors) participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan.

*The Company has selected a different index to use for
comparative purposes for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1997. In
the past, the Company has used the NASDAQ Non-Financial Stocks index;
however, the Company believes the NASDAQ Retail Trade Stocks index is
more closely related to its overall business, considering that the
majority of the Company's operating revenues are derived from retailers
