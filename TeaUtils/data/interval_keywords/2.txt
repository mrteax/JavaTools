                                 PROXY STATEMENT

                         ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
                             TO BE HELD MAY 11, 2001



         This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the shareholders of K-Tron
International, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders of the Company to be held on May 11, 2001 and any postponements or
adjournments thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the
enclosed Proxy Card are being mailed to shareholders on or about March 30, 2001.

         Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card are being solicited by
and on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for the purposes set
forth in the foregoing notice of meeting. The costs incidental to the
solicitation and obtaining of proxies, including the cost of reimbursing banks
and brokers for forwarding proxy materials to their principals, will be borne by
the Company. Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by officers
and employees of the Company by mail, telephone, telefax, personal interviews
and other methods of communication.

         The Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December
30, 2000, including consolidated financial statements and other information with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, is being mailed to shareholders
with this Proxy Statement. Such Annual Report is not part of this Proxy
Statement.


                              VOTING AT THE MEETING

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED; PROXIES

         Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2001
are entitled to notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting.
As of that date, the Company had outstanding 2,443,570 shares of Common Stock.
The holders of a majority of such shares, represented in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is necessary before
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting except that, even if a quorum
is not present, the shareholders present in person or by proxy shall have the
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Each
shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to one vote for each share of
Common Stock outstanding in such shareholder's name.

         The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed Proxy
Card will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the
shareholder signing such Proxy Card. The Proxy Card provides spaces for a
shareholder to vote for the nominees, or to withhold authority to vote for both
nominees or either nominee, for the Board of Directors. The nominees for
election as directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the
Annual Meeting. With respect to any other matter that may properly be brought
before the Annual Meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
by shareholders entitled to vote thereon is
<PAGE>   4
required to take action, unless a greater percentage is required either by law
or by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws. In
determining the number of votes cast with respect to any voting matter, only
those cast "for" or "against" are included. Abstentions will be considered
present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be counted as
votes cast. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on the vote. Similarly,
where brokers submit proxies but are prohibited and thus refrain from exercising
discretionary authority in voting shares on certain matters for beneficial
owners who have not provided voting instructions with respect to such matters
(commonly referred to as "broker non-votes"), those shares will be considered
present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be counted as
votes cast as to such matters and thus will have no effect on the vote.

         If a signed Proxy Card is returned and the shareholder has given no
direction with respect to a voting matter, the shares will be voted with respect
to that matter by the proxy agents as recommended by the Board of Directors or
its Executive Committee. Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy Card will
not affect a shareholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in
person. Any shareholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it by giving
notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time before the
proxy is voted.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

         The following table sets forth certain information as of March 15, 2001
(or as of such other date or dates as may be noted below) with respect to shares

Compensation Table under "Executive Compensation," by all current directors and

Common Stock. Except as indicated below, the Company understands that the
shareholders listed in such table have sole voting and investment power with
respect to the shares owned by them. The number of shares in the table below
includes shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options to the

                          MATTERS CONCERNING DIRECTORS

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

         The Board of Directors currently consists of six directors and is
classified with respect to terms of office into four classes. One additional
Board position in Class I is vacant. Each Class IV director elected at the
Annual Meeting will serve until the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders and
until such director's successor has been elected and qualified, except in the
event of such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. The terms of
office of the Class I, Class II and Class III directors will expire at the
annual meetings to be held in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, upon the
election and qualification of their successors.

         The Board of Directors has nominated Mr. Leo C. Beebe and Mr. Edward B.
Cloues, II for election as the Class IV directors. Both currently are directors
of the Company. The Board position in Class I which is now vacant may be left
vacant or may be filled at any time by vote of a majority of directors in office
prior to the next annual meeting of shareholders in 2002. If the vacancy is
filled by such a vote, the Class I director so elected would serve until the
2002 annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor has been elected and
qualified, except in the event of such director's earlier death, resignation or
removal.

         The persons named as proxy agents in the enclosed Proxy Card intend
(unless instructed otherwise by a shareholder) to vote for the election of Mr.
Leo C. Beebe and Mr. Edward B. Cloues, II as the Class IV directors. In the
event that a nominee should become unable to accept nomination or election (a
circumstance which the Board of


                                        4
<PAGE>   7
Directors does not expect), the proxy agents intend to vote for any alternate
nominee designated by the Board of Directors or its Executive Committee or, in
the discretion of the Board or its Executive Committee, the position may be left
vacant.

COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS

         The Board of Directors has an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee,
a Compensation and Human Resources Committee and a Nominating Committee. The
members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee also constitute the
members of the two committees which administer the Company's employee stock
option plans (collectively, the "Stock Option Committee"). During fiscal year
2000, the Board of Directors held eight meetings (including three by telephone
conference), the Executive Committee did not meet, the Audit Committee held
three meetings, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee held four
meetings, the Nominating Committee held one meeting and the Stock Option
Committee did not meet separately from the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the fiscal
year 2000 meetings of the Board of Directors and of the Board committee or
committees on which he served during the year.

         The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of the
Board of Directors, except action on dividends and certain other matters which
cannot by law be delegated by the Board, during the periods between regular
Board meetings. The primary duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee
are to serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the Company's
financial reporting process and internal control systems, review the
independence and performance of the Company's independent accountants, and
provide an open avenue of communication among the independent accountants,
financial and senior management of the Company and the Board. The Compensation
and Human Resources Committee recommends to the Board the compensation of the
Company's chief executive officer, reviews and takes action on the chief
executive officer's recommendations regarding the appropriate compensation of
the Company's other executive officers and also of any other direct reports to
the chief executive officer, approves the granting of any bonuses to such
officers and direct reports and the total size of any Company-wide bonus pool,
reviews other compensation and personnel development matters generally and
recommends to the Board the compensation of non-employee directors. The
Nominating Committee's principal duties are to recommend to the Board nominees
for election as directors, changes in the membership of the committees of the
Board and the membership of any newly-created Board committee. The Stock Option
Committee is responsible for administering the Company's 1996 Equity
Compensation Plan and another stock option plan which has expired (but under
which there remain outstanding stock options).

         The current members of the Executive Committee are Messrs. Cloues
(Chairman), Beebe and Cohen; of the Audit Committee, Messrs. Pinola (Chairman)
and Engel and Dr. Schurmann; of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee,
Messrs. Cohen (Chairman) and Pinola; of the Nominating Committee, Messrs. Beebe
(Chairman) and Cloues; and of the Stock Option Committee, Messrs. Cohen and
Pinola.

STANDARD COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

         Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual
retainer of $12,500, a $2,000 annual retainer for each membership on any of the
Audit Committee, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee and the
Nominating Committee, a $1,000 annual retainer for membership on the Executive
Committee, $1,000 for


                                        6
<PAGE>   9
each Board meeting attended and $750 for each Executive Committee meeting
attended provided that, in the case of Executive Committee meetings, such
meetings either require substantial preparation or last two hours or more. In
addition, the chairman of the Audit Committee and the chairman of the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee are each paid an additional $1,500
for their service in such capacities. All retainers are paid on a prorated
bi-monthly basis. Directors generally do not receive compensation for their
participation in telephone meetings or for attendance at other committee
meetings. Under the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan, non-employee directors are
eligible to receive stock options and, unless the Stock Option Committee
determines otherwise (which has not been the case in the past), on the date of
each annual meeting of shareholders of the Company, each non- employee director
receives a stock option grant to purchase 1,000 shares of Common Stock with an
option price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock
on that date. Such options are fully vested on the date of grant and have a
ten-year term.

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE

         Each non-employee director is required to own shares of Company Common
Stock with a value, at the greater of cost or market, equal to four times the
current $12,500 annual retainer, or $50,000. As for any newly- elected director,
this requirement may be phased in over a period of time to be determined by the
Board. All directors are in compliance with this guideline.

REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF NOMINATIONS

         Article Ninth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company provides that no person may be nominated for election as a director by a
shareholder at an annual or special meeting unless written notice of such
shareholder's intent to make such nomination has been given, either by personal
delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the
Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than (i)
with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of shareholders, 90
days in advance of such meeting and (ii) with respect to an election to be held
at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the close of
business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting
is first given to shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name
and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the
person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the shareholder is
a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or
persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or
understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or
nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d) such other information
regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be
included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended
to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e) the consent of each nominee
to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. The Nominating Committee
may, in its discretion, consider nominees for the Board of Directors recommended
by a shareholder according the foregoing procedure, but it is not obligated to
do so, and the chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination
of any person not made in compliance with such procedure.

CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

         Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt were employed by the Company or a
subsidiary during fiscal year 2000 under employment agreements with the Company
(the "Employment Agreements"). Under the Employment Agreements, Messrs. Bowen,
Remick and Guenthardt are entitled to receive a base salary, which may be
increased from time to time, and such additional compensation and bonus payments
as may be awarded to them. During fiscal year 2000, the annual base salaries for
Messrs. Remick and Guenthardt were $178,500 and $173,250, respectively. Mr.
Bowen's annual base salary was $173,250 through July 31, 2000 and $210,000
thereafter. As of the beginning of fiscal year 2001, Messrs. Remick's and
Guenthardt's annual base salaries were increased to $191,000 and $185,500,
respectively, and Mr. Bowen's remained at $210,000. The Company's obligation to
pay such base salaries is subject to its right to reduce them in the event
reductions are generally being made for other officers of the Company or its
subsidiaries holding comparable positions.

         Under Mr. Remick's employment agreement, he received a stock option
grant to purchase 7,500 shares of Common Stock on May 10, 2000, the first
anniversary of the commencement of his employment with the Company, at a
purchase price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, with 1,875
shares to vest on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of
the date of grant. In addition, under Mr. Remick's employment agreement, he will
receive a similar option grant for 5,000 shares of Common Stock on May 10, 2001,
the second anniversary of the commencement of his employment with the Company.

         Each of the Employment Agreements provides that either the Company or
the employee may terminate the employment term thereunder upon not less than one
year's prior notice. Such employment terms are also subject to


                                       11
<PAGE>   14
termination by reason of the employee's death or disability or by the Board of
Directors at any time for "cause" as specified in the Employment Agreements. In
addition, the Company has the right to terminate any of Messrs. Bowen, Remick or
Guenthardt at any time without cause by paying him a lump sum amount equal to
100% of his then-annual base salary or, if the previously described one-year
notice of termination has already been given by the Company to him, the portion
thereof relating to the balance of the employment term.

         Mr. Cloues was employed by the Company during fiscal year 2000 under an
employment agreement with the Company pursuant to which he served as the
Company's Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. During
fiscal year 2000, Mr. Cloues' annual base salary was $420,000. As of the
beginning of fiscal year 2001, Mr. Cloues' annual base salary was increased to
$436,800.

         Mr. Cloues' employment agreement provides that he can terminate the
agreement upon not less than 90 days' prior notice. The Company may terminate
the employment term without cause upon not less than 30 days' prior written
notice to Mr. Cloues, in which case Mr. Cloues would be entitled to a lump sum
payment equal to 200% of his then-annual base salary. Mr. Cloues' employment
term is also subject to termination by reason of his death or disability or by
the Board of Directors at any time for "cause" as specified in his employment
agreement.

         Mr. Cloues' employment agreement also includes provisions relating to a
termination of employment upon a "change of control" (as specified in his
employment agreement). Mr. Cloues' employment agreement applies to a termination
of employment upon or within one year after a "change of control" which, if such
termination was initiated by the Company or any successor thereto, was for any
reason other than death, disability or "cause" or which, if such termination was
initiated by Mr. Cloues, was at his sole discretion without regard to reason. In
the event of the termination of employment of Mr. Cloues upon a "change of
control," his employment agreement provides that, subject to certain
limitations, the Company would pay him (i) an amount equal to three times his
annual base salary in effect either immediately prior to the termination of
employment or immediately prior to the "change of control," whichever is higher
and (ii) unless Mr. Cloues notifies the Company in writing that he intends to
retain his options, an amount equal to the spread (the excess of market value
over exercise price) on any stock options then held by him, whether or not such
options were exercisable at the date of termination.

         NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, THE FOLLOWING REPORTS OF THE
         COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
         AND THE PERFORMANCE GRAPH ON PAGE 16 SHALL NOT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED
         BY REFERENCE BY ANY GENERAL STATEMENT INCORPORATING BY REFERENCE THIS
         PROXY STATEMENT INTO ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
         AMENDED, OR UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED,
         EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY INCORPORATES THIS
         INFORMATION BY REFERENCE, AND SHALL NOT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED FILED UNDER
         SUCH ACTS.


                           REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION
                          AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE

         As members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the
"Compensation Committee"), it is our duty to review the compensation paid to the
Company's executive officers and the other benefits received by them, to
recommend to the Board the annual base salary of the Company's Chief Executive
Officer, to approve the annual base salaries of the other executive officers, to
approve all bonuses and other material compensation granted to the Chief
Executive Officer and other executive officers and to approve the total amount
of all bonuses paid by the Company under any Company-wide bonus or incentive
compensation program. In addition, we also constitute the committee (the "Stock
Option Committee") which administers the Company's 1996 Equity Compensation Plan
and thus are responsible for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation
rights and restricted stock to officers and other employees of the Company.
These duties and the other responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are
more fully described on page 6 of this Proxy Statement under the caption
"Matters Concerning Directors - Committees and Meetings." In fulfilling these
duties and responsibilities, it is the Compensation Committee's goal to have a
policy that will enable the Company to attract, retain and reward senior
officers who contribute to both its short-term and long-term success. Both
members of the Compensation Committee are non-employee, independent directors.

         The Company's compensation policy for executive officers is to pay
competitively and to be fair and equitable in the administration of pay. This is
the same policy applicable to all employees of the Company. The Company seeks to
balance the compensation paid to a particular individual with the compensation
paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside the Company
and at other similar companies.

         The granting of bonuses on an annual basis is subjective and is based
on a number of factors, and the Compensation Committee determined, upon the
recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer, that no cash bonuses would be
paid for fiscal year 2000. In addition, other than the stock option grant to Mr.
Remick to purchase 7,500 shares of Common Stock which was made in accordance
with the terms of his employment agreement, no stock option grants were made to
employees during fiscal year 2000.

         The Compensation Committee has not adopted or made any recommendation
to the Board regarding a bonus or other incentive compensation program for 2001.
Whether or not any such program is adopted or recommended, it is expected that
future stock options will be granted by the Stock Option Committee on a case-by-
case basis, as and when deemed appropriate, rather than as part of any incentive
compensation program.

         As with bonuses, the decisions of the Compensation Committee regarding
salaries are subjective and not based on any list of specific criteria. The
Company's Chief Executive Officer, Edward B. Cloues, II, had a 2000 base salary
of $420,000. With respect to the other four Named Executive Officers, their
annual base salaries during fiscal year 2000 were as follows: Mr. Remick,
$178,000; Mr. Bowen, $173,250 through July 31, 2000 and $210,000 thereafter; Mr.
Guenthardt, $173,250; and Mr. Steger, 195,000 Swiss francs. Effective at the
beginning of fiscal year 2001, Mr. Cloues' annual base salary was increased by
4% to $436,800, and the annual base salaries for Messrs. Remick and Guenthardt
were each increased by approximately 7% to $191,000 and $185,500, respectively.
Mr. Bowen's previously increased salary remained unchanged at $210,000, which
was the understanding with him


                                       13
<PAGE>   16
when his salary was increased in mid-2000. With respect to Mr. Steger, no
increase was approved since on January 22, 2001 he gave notice that he will be
leaving the Company. The Compensation Committee accepted the Chief Executive
Officer's salary recommendations for Messrs. Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt,
which were based on his subjective judgement but took into account a number of
factors, including the increased responsibilities assumed by all three
individuals during fiscal year 2000 (for example, Mr. Bowen took on worldwide
responsibility for the feeder business, Mr. Remick was put in charge of the
Company's e-Business and information technology efforts in addition to his role
as Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Guenthardt assumed leadership of the
newly-formed New Businesses group which encompasses the Company's pneumatic
conveying business and also led the effort to acquire Colormax Limited in
October 2000). The Compensation Committee took similar factors into account in
determining the Chief Executive Officer's 2001 salary.

         In summary, we believe that the salaries received by each of the Named
Executive Officers for fiscal year 2000 were reasonable in view of their past
and anticipated future contributions to the Company and that the salary
increases approved for fiscal year 2001 were similarly justified.

                          REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

         The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a formal written charter
approved and adopted by the Board of Directors on May 15, 2000. A copy of the
charter is attached hereto as Appendix A. In accordance with the charter, all
the members of the Audit Committee are independent, and the Audit Committee has
reviewed the adequacy of the charter during fiscal year 2000.

         The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process
on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee has
reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements to be contained in the
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000
with the Company's management and also with Arthur Andersen LLP, the Company's
independent accountants and auditors. Management is responsible for the
financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal
controls, and has represented to the Audit Committee that such financial
statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The independent accountants are responsible for expressing an
opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

         The Audit Committee has discussed with Arthur Andersen LLP the matters
required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61,
Communication with Audit Committees, as amended. Furthermore, the Audit
Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Arthur
Andersen LLP required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1
(Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), and the Audit Committee has
discussed with Arthur Andersen LLP that firm's independence from the Company and
its management.

AUDIT FEES

         The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Arthur
Andersen LLP for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for the
year ended December 30, 2000 and the reviews of the Company's


                                       14
<PAGE>   17
financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
for the year ended December 30, 2000 were $200,000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES

         There were no fees billed for the professional services rendered by
Arthur Andersen LLP during fiscal year 2000 relating to financial information
systems design and implementation.

ALL OTHER FEES

         The aggregate fees billed for all other services rendered by Arthur
Andersen LLP during fiscal year 2000, other than the services referred to above
under the captions "Audit Fees" and "Financial Information Systems Design and
Implementation Fees," were $71,000, and such other fees were primarily related
to preparation of the Company's U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign income tax
returns and to tax advice given to the Company.

         After considering the provision of services encompassed within the
above disclosures about fees (under the captions "Financial Information Systems
Design and Implementation Fees" and "All Other Fees"), the Audit Committee has
determined that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining
Arthur Andersen LLP's independence.

         Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit
Committee has recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Company's
audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 to be filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

                                PERFORMANCE GRAPH

         The following line graph compares the yearly change in the cumulative
total shareholder return on the Company's Common Stock for the past five fiscal
years with the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index
(the "S&P 500") and the Dow Jones Factory Equipment Industry Group, which is
described more fully below (the "Factory Equipment Group"). The graph assumes
that $100 was invested at the end of fiscal year 1995 in the Company's Common
Stock, the S&P 500 and the Factory Equipment Group. Dividend reinvestment has
been assumed and, with respect to companies in the Factory Equipment Group, the
returns of such companies have been weighted at each measurement point to
reflect relative stock market capitalization.

                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

         Arthur Andersen LLP has served as the Company's independent public
accountants and auditors since 1994. It is management's expectation that Arthur
Andersen LLP will continue in such capacity for the current year, but this
matter has not yet been considered by the Board of Directors. A representative
of Arthur Andersen LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the
opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and to be
available to respond to appropriate questions.


                  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS -- 2002 ANNUAL MEETING

         Shareholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for
shareholder action at annual meetings in accordance with regulations adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any proposal which an eligible
shareholder desires to have presented at the 2002 annual meeting of shareholders
(which is expected to be held on or about May 10, 2002) concerning a proper
subject for inclusion in the proxy statement and for consideration at the annual
meeting, will be included in the Company's proxy statement and related proxy
card if it is received by the Company no later than November 22, 2001.


             SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
requires that directors and certain officers of the Company, and persons who own
more than ten percent of the Company's Common Stock, file reports of ownership
of Company securities and changes in ownership of Company's securities with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that all filings
required to be made during fiscal year 2000 were made on a timely basis.


                                  OTHER MATTERS

         The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to bring any
other matters before the Annual Meeting and has no reason to believe any other
matters will be presented. If, however, other matters properly do come before
the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxy agents in the
enclosed Proxy Card to vote upon such matters in accordance with their judgment.

                           K-TRON INTERNATIONAL, INC.

                         CHARTER OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
                            OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

                              Adopted May 15, 2000

I.  PURPOSE

The primary purpose of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of
Directors (the "Board") of K-Tron International, Inc. (the "Company") is to
assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the
quality and integrity of the Company's financial reports; the Company's systems
of internal controls regarding finance and accounting; and the Company's
auditing, accounting and financial reporting processes generally. The
Committee's primary duties and responsibilities are to:

    -    Serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the Company's
         financial reporting process and internal control systems.

    -    Review the independence and performance of the Company's independent
         accountants.

    -    Provide an open avenue of communication among the independent
         accountants, financial and senior management of the Company and the
         Board.

The Committee will primarily fulfill the above duties and responsibilities by
carrying out the activities enumerated in Section III of this Charter.

II.  COMPOSITION

The Committee shall be comprised of three or more directors, and, not later than
June 14, 2001, the members of the Committee shall meet the following
requirements of this Section II. Each member of the Committee shall be an
"independent director" as that term is defined in the Nasdaq Audit Committee
requirements*, and free from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board,
may interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment as a member
of the Committee or independence from management and the Company. Each member of
the Committee must be able to read and understand fundamental financial
statements, including the Company's balance sheet, income statement and cash
flow statement, or will become able to do so within a reasonable period of time
after his or her appointment to the Committee. Additionally, at least one member
of the Committee must have had past employment experience in finance or
accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or any other
comparable experience or background which results in the individual's financial
sophistication, including being or having been a chief executive officer, chief
financial officer or other senior officer with financial oversight
responsibilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one director who is not
independent and is not a current employee or an immediate family member of such
employee, may be appointed to the Committee, if the Board, under exceptional and
limited circumstances, determines that membership on the Committee by the
individual is required by the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders, and the Board discloses, in the next annual proxy statement
subsequent to such determination, the nature of the relationship and the reasons
for that determination.

III.  ACTIVITIES

To fulfill its responsibilities and duties, the Committee shall perform the
following activities:

1.   With respect to financial reports, the Committee shall:

     -   Review and discuss the Company's audited financial statements with the
         Company's management and the independent accountants and recommend to
         the Board the inclusion of such statements in the Company's annual
         filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on Form
         10-K.
<PAGE>   21
     -   At the discretion of the Chair of the Committee, review and discuss the
         Company's unaudited quarterly financial statements with the Company's
         management and the independent accountants prior to the filing of the
         Form 10-Q with the SEC. The Chair may represent the entire Committee
         for purposes of this review.

2.   With respect to the independent accountants, the Committee shall:

     -   Review, approve and recommend to the Board the engagement of the
         independent accountants, including their fee and the other material
         aspects of their engagement, and review the scope and timing of their
         audit of the Company's annual financial statements.

     -   Review, with the independent accountants, the accountants' report on
         the Company's annual financial statements and discuss with the
         independent accountants the matters required to be discussed by the
         relevant SAS(s), including the quality, and not just the acceptability,
         of the accounting principles and underlying estimates used in the
         audited financial statements.

     -   Evaluate the performance of the independent accountants; where
         appropriate, recommend that the Board replace the independent
         accountants; and approve any proposed discharge of the independent
         accountants.

     -   On an annual basis, obtain from the independent accountants a written
         disclosure delineating all relationships between such accountants and
         the Company and its affiliates, including the written disclosure and
         letter required by Independence Standards Board (ISB) Standard No. 1,
         as it may be modified or supplemented.

     -   From time to time, as appropriate, actively engage the Company's
         independent accountants in a dialogue with respect to any disclosed
         relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and
         independence of such accountants and take, or recommend to the Board
         the taking of, appropriate action in response to any disclosure to
         satisfy itself or the Board of the accountants' independence.

     -   Inform the independent accountants that they are ultimately accountable
         to the Board and the Committee, as representatives of the Company's
         shareholders.

     -   Periodically discuss with the independent accountants the Company's
         internal controls (including their recommendations, if any, for
         improvements in such internal controls and the implementation of such
         recommendations), the fullness and accuracy of the Company's financial
         statements and certain other matters required to be discussed by
         Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (SAS 61)**, as it may be
         modified or supplemented.

3.   As part of its review function, the Committee shall:

     -   Meet at least annually with the Company's management and the
         independent accountants in separate executive sessions to discuss any
         matters that the Committee or either of these groups believes should be
         discussed confidentially.

     -   In consultation with the independent accountants, review the integrity
         and quality of the Company's financial reporting processes, both
         internal and external, and the independent accountants' perception of
         the Company's financial and accounting personnel.

     -   Consider the independent accountants' judgments about the quality and
         appropriateness of the Company's accounting principles as applied and
         significant judgments affecting its financial reporting.

4.   With respect to ethical and legal compliance matters, the Committee shall:


                                        2
<PAGE>   22
     -   Review the adequacy and appropriateness of the Company's Statement of
         Corporate Ethics and Code of Business Conduct.

     -   State in the Committee's report in the Company's annual proxy statement
         whether, based on the review and discussions referred to in the
         relevant items of this Charter, the Committee recommended to the Board
         that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Form
         10-K filing for the last fiscal year.

5.   With respect to other matters, the Committee shall:

     -   Review and reassess the adequacy of this Charter on an annual basis and
         recommend updates to the Board, if any shall be required.

     -   Perform any other activities consistent with this Charter, the
         Company's By-laws and applicable law, as the Committee or the Board
         deems necessary or appropriate.

- ------------------

*    "Independent director" means a person other than an officer or employee of
     the Company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a
     relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the
     exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a
     director. The following persons shall not be considered independent:

     (a) a director who is employed by the Company or any of its affiliates for
         the current year or any of the past three years;

     (b) a director who accepts any compensation from the Company or any of its
         affiliates in excess of $60,000 during the previous fiscal year, other
         than compensation for Board service, benefits under a tax-qualified
         retirement plan or non-discretionary compensation;

     (c) a director who is a member of the immediately family of an individual
         who is, or has been in any of the past three years, employed by the
         Company or any of its affiliates as an executive officer. Immediate
         family includes a person's spouse, parents, children, siblings,
         mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law,
         son-in-law, daughter-in-law and anyone who resides in such person's
         home;

     (d) a director who is a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or an
         executive officer of, any for-profit business organization to which the
         Company made, or from which the Company received, payments (other than
         those arising solely from investments in the Company's securities) that
         exceed 5% of the Company's or business organization's consolidated
         gross revenues for that year, or $200,000, whichever is more, in any of
         the past three years; or

     (e) a director who is employed as an executive of another entity where any
         of the Company's executives serve on that entity's compensation
         committee.

**       SAS 61 requires independent auditors to communicate certain matters
         related to the conduct of an audit to those who have responsibility for
         oversight of the financial reporting process, specifically an audit
         committee. Among the matters to be communicated to the audit committee
         are: (1) methods used to account for significant unusual transactions;
         (2) the effect of authoritative guidance or consensus; (3) the process
         used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting
         estimates and the basis for the accountants' conclusions regarding the
         reasonableness of those estimates; and (4) disagreements with
         management over the application of accounting principles, the basis for
         management's accounting estimates and the disclosures in the financial
         statements.
