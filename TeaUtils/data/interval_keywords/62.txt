                                  PROXY STATEMENT

          The  following   information  is  furnished  in  connection  with  the
solicitation  of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company for the Annual
Meeting of  Shareholders  to be held on  Wednesday,  September 22, 1999, at 4:00
P.M., Atlanta time, at the Company's Corporate Headquarters,  1945 The Exchange,
Suite 300,  Atlanta,  Georgia.  A copy of the  Company's  Annual  Report for the
fiscal  year  ended  April  30,  1999,  and a proxy for use at the  meeting  are
enclosed with this Proxy Statement.  This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy
were first mailed to shareholders on or about August 13, 1999.

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

          Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked,  without
compliance  with any other  formalities,  by any  shareholder  who  attends  the
meeting  and gives oral  notice of his or her  election  to vote in  person.  In
addition,  any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked prior to
the meeting by delivering to the President of the Company a notice of revocation
or a duly executed  proxy for the same shares  bearing a later date. All proxies
of  shareholders  solicited  by the  Company  which are  properly  executed  and
received by the President of the Company prior to the meeting, and which are not
revoked,  will be voted at the meeting.  The shares  represented by such proxies
will  be  voted  in  accordance  with  the  instructions   thereon,  and  unless
specifically instructed to vote otherwise, the individuals named in the enclosed
proxy will vote to elect all the nominees as set forth in this Proxy  Statement.
Abstentions  and broker  non-votes  will be  included in  determining  whether a
quorum is present at the Annual  Meeting,  but will  otherwise have no effect on
the election of the nominees for Director.  For purposes of determining approval
of a matter  presented  at the meeting  other than the  election  of  Directors,
abstentions  will be deemed  present and  entitled to vote and will,  therefore,
have the same  legal  effect  as a vote  "against  " a matter  presented  at the
meeting.  Broker  non-votes  will be deemed not  entitled to vote on the subject
matter as to which the non-vote is indicated and will, therefore,  have no legal
effect  on the vote on that  particular  matter.  A system  administered  by the
Company's transfer agent will tabulate the votes cast.

          The cost of  soliciting  proxies  is paid by the  Company.  Copies  of
solicitation  material  may be furnished  to banks,  brokerage  houses and other
custodians,  nominees and  fiduciaries  for  forwarding to beneficial  owners of
shares of the  Company's  common  stock,  $1.00 par value per share (the "Common
Stock"), and normal handling charges may be paid for such forwarding service. In
addition to soliciting by mail,  Directors and regular employees of the Company,
at no additional compensation,  may assist in soliciting proxies by telephone or
other means.

          As of August 9, 1999,  the record date for the Annual  Meeting,  there
were  2,936,356  shares of Common Stock  outstanding  and entitled to vote.  The
holders  of  Common  Stock,  the only  class  of  voting  stock  of the  Company
outstanding, are entitled to one vote per share.

                      NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

          The  Board  of  Directors  recommends  the  election  of the  nine (9)
nominees  listed below to  constitute  the entire Board to hold office until the
next Annual Meeting of Shareholders  and until their  successors are elected and
qualified. If, at the time of the Annual Meeting, any of such nominees should be
unable to serve,  the persons named in the proxy will vote for such  substitutes
or vote to reduce the number of  Directors  for the ensuing  year as  management
recommends.  Management has no reason to believe that any substitute  nominee or
nominees or reduction  in the number of  Directors  for the ensuing year will be
required.  The affirmative  vote of a plurality of the votes cast is required to
elect the nominees.

          The  Company's  By-Laws  contain an advance  notice  procedure for the
nomination  of  candidates  for  election  to  the  Board.  Notice  of  proposed
shareholder nominations for election of Directors must be given to the Secretary
of the  Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting
at which Directors are to be elected, unless the notice of meeting is given less
than 60 days prior to the meeting,  in which case the notice of nomination  must
be received  not later than the 10th day  following  the day on which the notice
of meeting was mailed to  shareholders.  The notice of  nomination  must contain
information  about each proposed  nominee,  including  age,  address,  principal
occupation,  the number of shares of stock of the Company  beneficially owned by
such  nominee and such other  information  as would be required to be  disclosed
under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange  Act"),  in connection
with any  acquisition  of shares by such  nominee  or with the  solicitation  of
proxies by such nominee for his election as a Director. Information must also be
disclosed by and about the  shareholder  proposing to nominate that person.  The
Chairman of a shareholder  meeting may refuse to  acknowledge  the nomination of
any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

          All of the nominees, with the exception of Ms. Melinda S. Garrett, are
now  Directors  of the Company and have  served  continuously  since their first
election.  The  following  information  relating to: (1) age as of September 22,
1999; (2) directorships in other publicly-held companies; (3) positions with the
Company; (4) principal employment; and (5) Common Stock owned beneficially as of
April  30,  1999,  has been  furnished  by the  respective  nominees.  Except as
otherwise indicated, each nominee has been or was engaged in his present or last
principal  employment,  in the same or a  similar  position,  for more than five
years.

                  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
                          REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

          The  objectives of the Company's  compensation  program are to enhance
the  profitability  of the  Company,  and thus  shareholder  value,  by aligning
compensation with business goals and performance, and attracting,  retaining and
rewarding  Executive  Officers who  contribute to the  long-term  success of the
Company. In furtherance of these goals, the Company's  compensation  program for
Executive  Officers  includes base salary and annual bonus. In addition,  at the
discretion  of  the  Board  of  Directors,   selected   Executive  Officers  may
participate in the Senior Management  Deferral Plan, which is designed to permit
eligible  employees  to defer a portion  of their  incentive  compensation.  The
Compensation  Committee reviews the compensation and approves the base salary of
the Company's Executive Officers.

          SALARY.  The Compensation Committee determines the base salary for the
Executive  Officers,  including the CEO,  based upon the  financial  performance
(including  profitability and/or revenues) of the Company or subsidiary,  as the
case may be, and upon the individual's  level of  responsibility,  time with the
Company,   contribution  and   performance.   Evaluation  of  these  factors  is
subjective,  and no  fixed,  relative  weights  are  assigned  to  the  criteria
considered.  The beginning  point for  determining the salary is the base salary
the Executive Officer received in the prior fiscal year.

          BONUS. The majority of the Bonuses and All Other Compensation reported
in the Summary  Compensation Table was paid as annual cash bonuses, as described
below,  and  pursuant to the  Company's  profit-sharing  plan.  In general,  all
employees  meeting certain service  requirements  are eligible to participate in
the  profit-sharing  plan.  The  aggregate  contribution  of the  Company is set
annually by the Board of  Directors  and then  allocated  based on the  eligible
compensation of participants.  As a result,  profit-sharing plan allocations are
based on the same factors as are the salaries of the Executive Officers.

          The Board of  Directors  of the Company or the Board of Directors of a
subsidiary  company, as the case may be, determines the amount of an annual cash
bonus,  separate  from the  profit-sharing  plan,  for certain of the  Executive
Officers.  These  bonuses are based upon the  financial  performance  (including
profitability and/or revenues) of the Company or subsidiary, as the case may be,
and upon  the  individual's  level of  responsibility,  time  with the  Company,
contribution and performance.

          The  Company  does not  anticipate  that the law  that  serves  to cap
executive compensation that is deductible by the Company at $1,000,000 will have
any impact on the compensation policies of the Company.

          The tables included in the Proxy Statement and accompanying  narrative
and footnotes reflect the decisions covered by the above discussion.

          The  foregoing  report  has  been  furnished  by  the  members  of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors: Paula Lawton Bevington, Donald

                                DIRECTORS COMPENSATION

          Currently,  each  Director  is paid a retainer of $600 per month and a
fee of $1,300 per Board of Directors  meeting attended.  In addition,  Directors
who are members of the Audit  Committee or Compensation  Committee,  but who are
not  Executive  Officers of the  Company,  are paid a fee of $600 for each Audit
Committee or Compensation Committee meeting attended.

          DIRECTORS'  DEFERRED   COMPENSATION  PLAN.  The  Company  maintains  a
Directors' Deferred  Compensation Plan (the "Deferred  Compensation Plan") under
which  members of the Board of  Directors of the Company may elect to defer to a
future date receipt of all or any part of their compensation as Directors and/or
as  members  of  a  committee  of  the  Board.  For  purposes  of  the  Deferred
Compensation  Plan,  "compensation"  means the  retainer  fees and meeting  fees
payable to such Directors by the Company in their  capacities as Directors or as
members of the Audit or Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

          The  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  is  administered  by the  Executive
Committee of the Board of Directors.  A committee  member may not participate in
any decision  relating in any way to his  individual  rights or obligations as a
participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

          The  Company  will make  payments  of  deferred  compensation  and the
earnings on such deferred  compensation under the Deferred  Compensation Plan at
the time specified by each  participant in a lump sum or, at the sole discretion
of the participant, in no more than five equal annual installments. For the year
ended April 30, 1999,  four members of the Board of Directors  (including  three
Executive  Officers  who  are  also  Directors)  participated  in  the  Deferred
Compensation Plan.

            INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

          KPMG LLP were  the  independent  public  accountants  for the  Company
during the year ended April 30, 1999.  Representatives  of KPMG LLP are expected
to be present  at the Annual  Meeting  and will have the  opportunity  to make a
statement if they desire to do so and to respond to appropriate  questions.  The
Board of Directors has not selected auditors for the present fiscal year because
the matter has not yet been considered.

                             SHAREHOLDERS PROPOSALS

          In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Rule  14a-8(a)(3)(I)  of the
Securities and Exchange  Commission,  proposals of  shareholders  intended to be

be eligible for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement and form of proxy for
that  meeting.  The Company must be notified of any other  shareholder  proposal
intended to be presented for action at the meeting not later than 45 days before
the Company's 2000 Annual Meeting, or else proxies may be voted on such proposal
at the discretion of the person or persons holding those proxies.

          The Company's  By-Laws  require  notice to the Secretary in advance of
any regular  shareholders'  meeting of any  shareholder  proposals.  The By-Laws
further require that in connection with such proposals the shareholders  provide
certain  information to the Secretary.  The summary  descriptions of the By-Laws
contained  in this Proxy  Statement  are not  intended to be  complete,  and are
qualified in their  entirety by  reference to the text of the By-Laws  which are

                                 OTHER MATTERS

          The Board of Directors  knows of no other matters to be brought before
the Annual  Meeting.  However,  if other  matters  should come before the Annual
Meeting, it is the intention of each person named in the proxy to vote the proxy
in accordance with his judgment of what  is in the best interest of the Company.
