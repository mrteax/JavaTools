PROXY STATEMENT
 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
October 9, 1996
 
SOLICITATION
 
This Proxy Statement is furnished to stockholders of AAR CORP., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company" or "AAR"), in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company to be used at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held in the Shareholders' Room
(21st Floor) of Bank of America Illinois, 231 S. LaSalle Street, Chicago,
Illinois, on Wednesday, October 9, 1996, at 3:00 P.M. (Chicago time), or any
adjournment thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement is first being
sent to holders of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share ("Common Stock") on or about August 26, 1996.
 
Any proxy solicited herewith may be revoked by a stockholder at any time prior
to the voting thereof by sending written notice of revocation to the Secretary
of the Company, or by delivering a later-dated proxy, or by attending the Annual
Meeting and voting in person. Shares of Common Stock represented by proxies that
are properly executed and returned to the Company will be voted as specified
thereon at the Annual Meeting. If no choice is specified, such shares will be
voted FOR the election of the four nominees for director designated by the Board
of Directors, FOR the amendment of the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan ("Plan") to
increase the total number of shares of Common Stock that become available for
award each year, and upon any other matters that may properly come before the
Annual Meeting in the discretion of the named proxies in accordance with their
best judgment. In the event any nominee is unavailable for election, which is
not presently anticipated, shares represented by valid proxies will be voted for
such other person or persons in the named proxies in accordance with their best
judgment.
 
As provided in the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan, shares held by the Dividend Reinvestment Agent for a participant will be
voted in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card received
representing such shares or otherwise as set forth above.
 
The cost of the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company and will
consist primarily of printing, postage and handling, including reimbursement to
banks, brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy material to their respective
principals. The Company has engaged D. F. King & Co., 77 Water Street, New York,
New York, to aid in the solicitation of proxies at a total estimated cost of
$7,500.00. D. F. King & Co. may solicit proxies by mail, personally, or by
telephone or telegraph. In addition to the solicitation of
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
proxies by D. F. King & Co. and by use of the mails, certain officers, directors
and employees of the Company may solicit proxies personally, or by telephone or
telegraph, without additional compensation.
 
QUORUM AND VOTING RIGHTS
 
At the close of business on August 12, 1996, the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, there were
outstanding 15,960,310 shares of Common Stock. Each stockholder of record is
entitled to one vote for every share of Common Stock held on the record date.
Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless the owner thereof is present
in person or by proxy. A quorum of stockholders is necessary to take action at
the Annual Meeting. The holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock
entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy will constitute a
quorum of stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Votes cast in person or by proxy
at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed
for the Annual Meeting. The inspectors of election will treat directions to
withhold authority, abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are present
and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Directions to
withhold authority will have no effect on the election of directors, because
directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-
votes will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a matter has been
approved, because they are not considered votes cast.
 
                                   PROPOSAL 1
 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company provide
that the Board of Directors shall consist of between three and fifteen
directors, with the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time by
the Board of Directors, and that the directors shall be divided into three
classes as nearly equal in number as possible. The Board of Directors has fixed
the number of directors on the Board at ten.
 
The ten members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes: Class
I (3 directors), Class II (3 directors) and Class III (4 directors). One class
is elected each year for a three-year term. At the Annual Meeting, A. Robert
Abboud, Howard B. Bernick, Ira A. Eichner and Robert D. Judson will be nominated
to serve in Class III until the 1999 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until
their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each of the nominees is
currently a director of the Company. Under Delaware law, the four nominees for
director who individually receive the greatest number of votes shall be elected
directors of the Company.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
 
Based solely upon a review of Securities and Exchange Commission Forms 3, 4 and
5 and upon related written representations furnished to the Company with respect
to its most recent fiscal year, no person who, at any time during the fiscal
year, was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of
any class of equity securities of the Company registered pursuant to Section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), failed to file on a
timely basis, as disclosed in the above Forms, reports required by Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year or prior fiscal years.
 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
GENERAL
 
The Company's executive compensation program is structured and administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), which is
comprised of the five individuals listed below, all of whom are independent
directors of the Company.
 
The executive compensation program is designed to enable the Company to attract,
motivate and retain talented executives capable of achieving strategic business
initiatives and to reward them for their achievement. It is intended to
complement the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives and to
focus executives' efforts on fulfilling these objectives. The program consists
of three elements: (i) base salaries which are generally set at approximately
the median salary level of comparable positions in similar companies, adjusted
up or down to reflect individual capabilities and responsibilities and
experience levels; (ii) annual variable incentive opportunities paid in cash and
stock based on individual contribution and performance; and (iii) long-term
incentive opportunities, in the form of stock option/restricted stock awards.
 
Total compensation opportunities for each executive are intended to be
competitive with those offered by other companies competing for their talent in
the Company's employment market. In designing and administering the individual
elements of the executive compensation program for each executive, the Committee
strives to balance short- and long-term incentive objectives and employ prudent
judgment in establishing base salary levels and performance criteria, evaluating
performance and determining actual incentive payments. To ensure competitiveness
and reasonableness of the Committee's compensation decisions, independent
compensation consulting firms are retained periodically to advise the Committee
in connection with both the design and implementation of the various elements of
the program and the level of individual executive participation. Generally, as
an executive's level of responsibility increases, a greater percentage of total
compensation is based on performance, and the mix of total compensation shifts
toward stock, thereby aligning the long-term interest of senior executives with
those of stockholders. To encourage stock ownership in the Company by senior
executives, the Company has established guidelines for ownership of Common Stock
by senior management equal in value to 75% of salary, to be voluntarily achieved
over the next several years. An executive's progress towards achieving these
guidelines will be used by the Committee in making incentive stock compensation
decisions for the executive in the future.
 
Base salary levels of all executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, are
reviewed annually and may be adjusted depending upon the executive's
responsibilities, assessed performance contribution, qualifications and tenure
in the Company and in the position held, and competitive salary considerations
relative to similar positions at selected companies in the employment market
from which the Company draws its executives.
 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer each have an annual
performance-based incentive bonus opportunity of up to 100% of their respective
base salary. That portion of the Chief Operating Officer's incentive bonus
opportunity in excess of 80% of his base salary is payable in restricted stock.
The percentage opportunity for other executive positions varies depending on
their
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
responsibility level, and 10% of any bonus paid is payable in restricted stock.
As pertains to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer,
three-fourths of their incentive opportunity is based upon operating profit
results and the remainder is based on asset management results. Performance
objectives for other executives are established annually and the incentive
opportunity varies depending on position.
 
The long-term incentive program consists of stock option and/or restricted stock
awards granted under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan approved by stockholders
in 1992.
 
Stock option awards typically expire 10 years from the date of grant or earlier
upon termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on
successive grant anniversary dates at the NYSE closing stock price on the date
of grant, and are accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals,
stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company. In
determining stock option and restricted stock awards, the Committee considers
the recipient's position and responsibilities in the Company, performance and
contributions made during the preceeding year, capabilities and potential for
future contribution to the Company, the number of options and awards previously
granted to the recipient and, for senior management, their progress toward
achieving the Company's guidelines for stock ownership by senior management.
 
Restrictions imposed on restricted stock awards vary and are designed, among
other things, to encourage executives to stay with the Company and to maintain a
focus on long-term objectives of the Company. Typically, restricted stock grants
vest over five (5) years (20% each anniversary) or over seven (7) years (25% on
4th anniversary, 25% on 6th anniversary and 50% on 7th anniversary); restricted
stock used in lieu of cash to pay earned bonuses vests over three (3) years (1/3
each anniversary). Typically, awards are subject to forfeiture if employment
terminates for any reason during the award cycle. During the award cycle the
participant receives dividends for the shares and also has the right to vote the
awarded shares.
 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
 
The base salary level of the Chief Executive Officer and founder of the Company
has been increased progressively since 1951 to reflect his performance,
leadership and responsibilities for increasingly complex and diversified
domestic and international operations as the Company has expanded into new
product lines and markets. Competitive compensation analyses by independent
consultants are used by the Committee to ensure that the Chief Executive
Officer's base salary is at an appropriate competitive level relative to base
salaries of chief executive officers at other companies in the relevant
employment market.
 
The Committee's action with respect to the Chief Executive Officer's total
fiscal year 1996 compensation reflects consideration of the base salary factors
discussed earlier, and the leadership role he played in the performance results
of the Company overall in a difficult environment and in maintaining the
financial strength and liquidity of the Company.
 
The Chief Executive Officer's base salary was increased 3% January 1, 1996 and
2 1/4% June 1, 1996, as were management salaries generally.
 
The Chief Executive Officer was awarded an incentive bonus equal to 100% of his
base salary reflecting achievement of (i) a 75% incentive opportunity benefit
for operating performance based on a substantial improvement over the prior year
in consolidated net sales (up 11.9%) and in net income (up 53%), and (ii) a 25%
incentive opportunity benefit for asset management based on improving the
balance sheet performance.
 
The Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers named in the
Summary Compensation Table below received the stock options and restricted stock
awards reflected in the table. The number of shares covered by each grant
reflects individual contributions and performance, as well as competitive
industry practices, in the view of the Committee; it also continues the
Committee's
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
emphasis on executive share ownership and furthers the Company's objective of
tying incentive compensation to performance and aligning executives' interests
with the interests of the Company's stockholders.
 
The tables which follow and accompanying footnotes and narrative reflect the
decisions covered by the above discussion.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 
The Internal Revenue Code places a $1 million cap on the deductibility of
compensation, subject to certain exceptions, paid to certain executives of
publicly held corporations. Since the current levels of compensation subject to
the cap will not exceed $1 million for any executives of the Company, the
Committee did not take into consideration the deductibility of compensation for
federal income tax purposes in establishing compensation of the named executives
during the present review cycle.
 
The Committee will continue to review the deductibility of Compensation under
Section 162(m) and any regulations adopted under it, with the goal of assuring
that compensation paid is deductible by the Company to the extent that this can
be reasonably accomplished in a manner that provides adequate incentives and
allows the Company to attract and retain qualified executives.
 
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
 
This report of the Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by
any general statement incorporating this Proxy Statement into any filing under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 or under the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"Acts"), except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this
report by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.

</TABLE>
 
The Company's Retirement Plan covers all named executive officers. Benefits
under the Retirement Plan are determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the
Retirement Plan and take into consideration years of credited service, a
percentage of the participant's final average compensation (the five highest
consecutive calendar years of compensation out of the employee's last ten
calendar years of employment) and adjustments for social security "covered
compensation" which is an "offset" under the Retirement Plan. The term
"compensation" means cash compensation shown as income on an employee's Form
W-2, plus amounts contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan and reduced by certain
items specified in the Retirement Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
compensation for purposes of the Retirement Plan is subject to an annual
$150,000 annual compensation limitation in accordance with applicable provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
The aggregate salary and bonus compensation shown for the executive officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table above is the compensation currently
included for purposes of determining benefits under the Retirement Plan and
SKERP described below. The number of years of credited service under the Plan
(effective maximum is 20 years), is as follows: Mr. Eichner, 20 years; Mr.
Storch, 18 years; Mr. Pulsifer, 9 years; Mr. Romenesko, 15 years; and Mr.
Slapke, 12 years. Benefits under the Retirement Plan may be limited by
applicable laws or regulations.
 
SUPPLEMENTAL KEY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
The Company also provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain executives
and key employees under the SKERP. All of the named executives are participants
in the SKERP, except that Mr. Eichner's participation does not include
supplemental retirement benefits. The SKERP is designed to restore the
approximate amount of employer-provided benefits under the Company's Retirement
Plan lost as a result of Internal Revenue Code limitations, including those
limiting compensation for purposes of benefit calculations. Such lost benefits
restored under the SKERP are
 
                                       12
<PAGE>
determined in the same manner, using the same compensation data and years of
credited service, as retirement benefits are determined under the Retirement
Plan described above, subject to maximum compensation limits established by the
Company from time to time (presently $350,000 for key employee participants and
$500,000 for executive officer participants). The SKERP also provides for
aggregate retirement benefits at fifty percent (50%) of final average
compensation (as defined in the Retirement Plan) for certain executive officers
designated by the Compensation Committee (including four of the named executive
officers), subject to maximum compensation limits established by the Company
from time to time and reduced by certain items specified in the Retirement Plan.
The SKERP is unfunded and supplemental retirement benefits thereunder are
forfeited if the participant violates a covenant not to compete set forth in the
SKERP or his or her employment is terminated for cause.
 
The Chief Executive Officer is also the beneficiary of a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan ("SERP"). Annual retirement benefits under the SERP are equal to
60% of the Chief Executive Officer's aggregate average of annual salary, bonus
and long-term incentive cash payments ("cash compensation") for the three fiscal
years during the ten fiscal years preceding the date of his termination of
active employment during which his cash compensation was highest, subject to an
offset for benefits received under the Retirement Plan and certain reductions.
Based on the Chief Executive Officer's cash compensation history to date, it is
estimated that he would receive an annual retirement benefit of $328,850 under
the SERP upon retirement at age 65. The Company funds the benefits through an
irrevocable trust arrangement with a bank. The level of funding is based on
actuarial computations determined by an independent actuary. The residual in the
trust upon the death of the Chief Executive Officer will be paid to the Chief
Executive Officer's estate or designated beneficiaries.
 
STOCKHOLDER RETURN PERFORMANCE GRAPHS
 
The following graphs compare the five-year cumulative total stockholder return
(including reinvestment of dividends) of the Company, the S&P (Standard &
Poor's) Composite--500 Stock Index, and a peer group index selected by the

The S&P Composite--500 Stock Index is composed of domestic industry leaders in
four major sectors: Industrials, Financials, Utilities and Transportation, and
serves as a broad indicator of the performance of the U.S. equity market. The
peer group index selected by the Company is comprised of companies engaged in
engine, airframe and/or manufacturing activities in support of the
aerospace/aviation aftermarket similar to those conducted by the Company. The
peer group selected by the Company is comprised of the following companies:
Aviall, Inc., Banner Aerospace, Inc., Greenwich Air Services, Inc., Hi-Shear

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION
 
Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary
each receive an annual retainer of $22,000, a fee of $1,500 for attendance at
each meeting of the Board of Directors or of any Board committee and
reimbursement of expenses. The chairman of each committee receives an additional
$1,500 annual retainer. The Company also provides each of its outside directors
with group term life insurance coverage of $200,000. In addition, under the AAR
CORP. Stock Benefit Plan, each outside director, upon becoming a director,
automatically receives stock options for 10,000 shares of the Common Stock which
can be exercised in 25% increments each anniversary grant date at the closing
NYSE price on the date of grant. Directors who are officers or employees of the
Company or any subsidiary receive no additional compensation for service on the
Board of Directors or any of its committees.
 
The Company also has a Directors' Retirement Plan for its outside directors. The
Plan provides for a benefit to outside directors upon retirement on or after age
65, provided they have completed at least five years of service as a director.
Benefits are payable as a quarterly annuity in an amount equal to 25% of the
annual retainer fee payable by the Company to an active outside director.
Payment of benefits commences upon retirement and continues for a period equal
to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a director to
a maximum of ten years or death, whichever first occurs. The Directors'
Retirement Plan is unfunded. As of May 31, 1996, one former director was
receiving benefits under the Directors' Retirement Plan.

                                   PROPOSAL 2
 
APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE AAR CORP. STOCK BENEFIT PLAN
 
The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously adopted, subject to
stockholder approval, an amendment (the "Amendment") to the AAR CORP. Stock
Benefit Plan ("Plan") to be presented at the Annual Meeting, increasing the
number of additional shares of Common Stock that become available each year for
award under the Plan from approximately 144,000 shares to approximately 320,000
shares (based upon the approximately 16,000,000 shares currently issued and
outstanding). Specifically, the Amendment revises the first sentence of Section
4.1 of the Plan to provide that the number of additional shares that become
available under the Plan on January 1 of each year from January 1, 1996, through
December 31, 2001, shall be 2% (rather than 0.9%) of the issued and outstanding
shares on each such date. The Plan expires by its terms on December 31, 2001.
 
As previously disclosed, the Company established stock ownership guidelines for
executives, took steps to pay portions of annual bonuses in stock in lieu of
cash and is granting options and stock to a wider range of employees in order to
increase the percentage of total pay based on performance and further align its
compensation program with stockholder interests. Based on a review of stock
compensation practices, including information supplied by the Company's
independent compensation consultant, the Board has determined that increasing
the number of shares available for awards each year is necessary and appropriate
in order to accomplish the Company's objectives of increasing the percentage of
pay based on performance and further aligning the interests of its employees
with those of its stockholders.
 
SUMMARY OF THE PLAN
 
The Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders in 1992. The Plan enables
the Company to grant incentive stock options with respect to a maximum of
1,000,000 shares, non-qualified stock options, reload options, "limited rights"
in tandem with option grants and restricted stock awards to Key Employees. It
also provides for automatic grants of non-qualified stock options to purchase
10,000 shares to each non-employee director in the year such person becomes a
director. Stock options entitle the holder to purchase Common Stock from the
Company for a specified exercise price during a period specified in the
applicable option agreement. Restricted stock awards entitle the recipient to
receive Common Stock from the Company under terms which provide for vesting over
a period of time, subject to forfeiture upon the termination of the recipient's
employment with the Company. The Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, which selects the persons to whom stock
options and other awards are granted and determines the number of shares of
Common Stock covered by the option or award, its exercise price or purchase
price, its vesting schedule and (in the case of stock options) its expiration
date.
 
As option grants and other awards under the Plan (other than the automatic
grants to non-employee directors) are discretionary, the Company cannot now
determine the number of any such
 
                                       16
<PAGE>
securities that will be granted in the future to any particular executive
officer, all executive officers as a group, or all employees as a group.
Information relating to awards made in fiscal year 1996 under the Plan to the
executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table is presented in the
various tables under the caption "Executive Compensation and Other Information."
In fiscal 1996, 127,000 options at an exercise price of $17.50 were granted to
all executive officers of the Company as a group, and 287,901 options at an
average exercise price of $17.66 were granted to all employees, including the
executive officers, of the Company as a group. As of May 31, 1996, there were
107 persons eligible to receive awards under the Plan.
 
The Plan will remain in effect until December 31, 2001, unless earlier
terminated by the Board of Directors.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
Neither non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, nor restricted
stock awards require the holder to recognize income at the time of grant.
 
Upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the holder will recognize
ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
option stock as of the date of exercise over the exercise price.
 
Upon the vesting of restricted stock awards, the holder will realize ordinary
income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at such time. A
holder may elect to recognize ordinary income on the fair market value of the
restricted stock at the time of the award, and thus recognize capital gain on
the subsequent sale of the stock in an amount equal to the excess of the fair
market value of the stock at vesting over the fair market value at the date of
the award.
 
Incentive stock options are not ordinarily subject to taxation until the holder
sells the option shares, although the excess of the fair market value of the
option stock over the exercise price is a tax preference item subject to
alternative minimum taxation at the time of exercise. When stock acquired
through exercise of an incentive stock option is sold at least two years after
grant and at least one year after exercise, the holder recognizes as capital
gain the excess of the sale proceeds of the option stock over the exercise
price. If these holding periods are not met, the holder will recognize ordinary
income.
 
The Company is entitled to deduct the amount of income recognized by the holder
upon the vesting of a restricted stock award or the exercise of a non-qualified
stock option, provided the Company complied with certain withholding
requirements. In the case of an incentive stock option, the Company is entitled
to no deduction where the holder recognizes capital gain; the Company is,
however, entitled to a deduction when and to the extent the holder recognizes
ordinary income.
 
VOTE REQUIRED
 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is
required to approve the Amendment.
 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT
TO THE AAR CORP. STOCK BENEFIT PLAN.
 
OTHER MATTERS
 
Management knows of no other matters which are to be brought before this Annual
Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting,
it is intended that the persons voting the proxies will vote them in accordance
with their judgment on such other matters.
