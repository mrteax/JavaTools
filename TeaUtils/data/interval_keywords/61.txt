                              PROXY STATEMENT

          The following information is furnished in connection with the 
solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company for the 
annual meeting of shareholders to be held on Wednesday, August 19, 1998, at 
4:00 P.M., Atlanta time, at the Corporate Headquarters, 1945 The Exchange, 
Suite 300, Atlanta, Georgia.  A copy of the Company's annual report for the 
fiscal year ended April 30, 1998, and a proxy for use at the meeting are 
enclosed with this proxy statement.  This proxy statement and the enclosed 
proxy were first mailed to shareholders on or about July 17, 1998.

                         GENERAL INFORMATION

          Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked, 
without compliance with any other formalities, by any shareholder who attends
the meeting and gives oral notice of his or her election to vote in person.  
In addition, any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked 
prior to the meeting by delivering to the President of the Company a notice 
of revocation or a duly executed proxy for the same shares bearing a later 
date.  All proxies of shareholders solicited by the Company which are 
properly executed and received by the President of the Company prior to the 
meeting, and which are not revoked, will be voted at the meeting.  The shares
represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions
thereon, and unless specifically instructed to vote otherwise, the 
individuals named in the enclosed proxy will vote to elect all the nominees 
as set forth in this proxy statement.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will 
be included in determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting,
but will otherwise have no effect on the election of the nominees for 
Director.  For purposes of determining approval of a matter presented at the 
meeting other than the election of directors, abstentions will be deemed 
present and entitled to vote and will, therefore, have the same legal effect 
as a vote "against" a matter presented at the meeting.  Broker non-votes will
be deemed not entitled to vote on the subject matter as to which the non-vote
is indicated and will, therefore, have no legal effect on the vote on that 
particular matter.  A system administered by the Company's transfer agent 
will tabulate the votes cast.

          The cost of soliciting proxies is paid by the Company.  Copies of 
solicitation material may be furnished to banks, brokerage houses and other 
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding to beneficial owners of 
shares of the Company's common stock, $1.00 par value per share (the "Common 
Stock"), and normal handling charges may be paid for such forwarding service.
In addition to soliciting by mail, Directors and regular employees of the 
Company, at no additional compensation, may assist in soliciting proxies by 
telephone or other means.

          As of July 9, 1998, the record date for the annual meeting, there 
were 2,936,356 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote.  The 
holders of Common Stock, the only class of voting stock of the Company 
outstanding, are entitled to one vote per share.

                               1
<PAGE>
                   NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

          The Board of Directors recommends the election of the nine (9) 
nominees listed below to constitute the entire Board to hold office until the
next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are elected 
and qualified.  If, at the time of the annual meeting, any of such nominees 
should be unable to serve, the persons named in the proxy will vote for such 
substitutes or vote to reduce the number of Directors for the ensuing year as
management recommends.  Management has no reason to believe that any 
substitute nominee or nominees or reduction in the number of Directors for 
the ensuing year will be required.  The affirmative vote of a plurality of 
the votes cast is required to elect the nominees.

          The Company's By-Laws contain an advance notice procedure for the 
nomination of candidates for election to the Board.  Notice of proposed 
shareholder nominations for election of directors must be given to the 
Secretary of the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to
the meeting at which directors are to be elected, unless the notice of 
meeting is given less than 60 days prior to the meeting, in which case the 
notice of nomination must be received not later than the 10th day following 
the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed to shareholders.  The 
notice of nomination must contain information about each proposed nominee, 
including age, address, principal occupation, the number of shares of stock 
of the Company beneficially owned by such nominee and such other information 
as would be required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the "Exchange Act"), in connection with any acquisition of shares by 
such nominee or with the solicitation of proxies by such nominee for his 
election as a director.  Information must also be disclosed by and about the 
shareholder proposing to nominate that person.  The chairman of a shareholder
meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in 
compliance with the foregoing procedure.

          All of the nominees are now Directors of the Company and have 
served continuously since their first election.  The following information 
relating to: (1) age as of August 19, 1998; (2) directorships in other 
publicly-held companies; (3) positions with the Company; (4) principal 
employment; and (5) Common Stock owned beneficially as of April  30, 1998, 
has been furnished by the respective nominees.  Except as otherwise 
indicated, each nominee has been or was engaged in his present or last 
principal employment, in the same or a similar position, for more than five 
years.

          The objectives of the Company's compensation program are to enhance
the profitability of the Company, and thus shareholder value, by aligning 
compensation with business goals and performance and attracting, retaining 
and rewarding Executive Officers who contribute to the long-term success of 
the Company. In furtherance of these goals, the Company's compensation 
program for Executive Officers includes base salary and annual bonus. In 
addition, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, selected Executive 
Officers may participate in the Senior Management Deferral Plan, which is 
designed to permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their incentive 
compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the 
compensation of the Company's Executive Officers. 

          SALARY.  The Compensation Committee determines the base salary for 
the Executive Officers, including the CEO, based upon the financial 
performance (including profitability and/or revenues) of the Company or 
subsidiary, as the case may be, and upon the individual's level of 
responsibility, time with the Company, contribution and performance. 
Evaluation of these factors is subjective, and no fixed, relative weights are
assigned to the criteria considered. The beginning point for determining the 
salary is the base salary the Executive Officer received in the prior fiscal 
year.

          BONUS.  The majority of the Bonuses and All Other Compensation 
reported in the Summary Compensation Table was paid as annual cash bonuses, 
as described below, and pursuant to the Company's profit-sharing plan. In 
general, all employees meeting certain service requirements are 

                               9<PAGE>
eligible to participate in the profit-sharing plan. The aggregate contribution
of the Company is set annually by the Board of Directors and then allocated
based on the eligible compensation of participants.  As a result,
profit-sharing plan allocations are based on the same factors as are 
the salaries of the Executive Officers.  

          The Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of 
a subsidiary company, as the case may be, determines the amount of an annual 
cash bonus, separate from the profit-sharing plan, for certain of the 
Executive Officers. These bonuses are based upon the financial performance 
(including profitability and/or revenues) of the Company or subsidiary, as 
the case may be, and upon the individual's level of responsibility, time with
the Company, contribution and performance.  

          The Company does not anticipate that the law that serves to cap 
executive compensation that is deductible by the Company at $1,000,000 will 
have any impact on the compensation policies of the Company.

          The tables included in the proxy statement and accompanying 
narrative and footnotes reflect the decisions covered by the above 
discussion. 

          The foregoing report has been furnished by the members of the 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors: Paula Lawton Bevington, 
Donald W. MacLeod, L. Anthony Montag, Felker W. Ward, Jr.


                           DIRECTORS COMPENSATION

          Each Director is paid a retainer of $600 per month and a fee of 
$1,300 per Board of Directors meeting attended.  In addition, Directors who 
are members of the Audit Committee or Compensation Committee, but who are not
Officers of the Company, are paid a fee of $600 for each Audit Committee or 
Compensation Committee meeting attended.

          DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN.  The Company maintains a 
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") 
under which members of the Board of Directors of the Company may elect to 
defer to a future date receipt of all or any part of their compensation as 
Directors and/or as members of a committee of the Board.  For purposes of the
Deferred Compensation Plan, "compensation" means the retainer fees and 
meeting fees payable to such Directors by the Company in their capacities as 
Directors or as members of the Audit or Compensation Committee of the Board 
of Directors.

          The Deferred Compensation Plan is administered by the Executive 
Committee of the Board of Directors.  A committee member may not participate 
in any decision relating in any way to his individual rights or obligations 
as a participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

          The Company will make payments of deferred compensation and the 
earnings on such deferred compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan 
at the time specified by each participant in a lump sum or, at the sole 
discretion of the participant, in no more than five equal annual 
installments.  For the year ended April 30, 1998, four members of the Board 
of Directors (including three Executive Officers who are also Directors) 
participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan.
