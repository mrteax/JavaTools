Dear Shareholder:
 
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of AAR
CORP. (the "Company") to be held on Wednesday, October 8, 1997, commencing at
3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) at 231 S. LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois. The Board
of Directors and management look forward to personally greeting those
shareholders attending the meeting.
 
At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the election
of three Class I directors to serve for a three-year term expiring at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders in the year 2000. This year, in addition to electing
three directors, you are also being asked to consider and approve three Internal
Revenue Code Section 162(m) performance compensation related proposals.
 
Your approval of these Section 162(m) related proposals is necessary in order to
qualify Compensation Committee approved stock option awards under the AAR CORP.
Stock Benefit Plan and performance-based restricted stock incentive awards and
performance-based cash incentive bonus awards, as "performanced-based"
compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, so
that the Company will be entitled to full tax deductibility of such awards.
These proposals are described more fully in the Company's Proxy Statement which
you are urged to read carefully.
 
Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the election of
Directors, and FOR each of the other three Section 162(m) related proposals.
 
Regardless of the number of shares you own and whether or not you plan to
attend, it is important that your shares be represented and voted at the Annual
Meeting. Accordingly, you are requested to sign, date and mail the enclosed
proxy at your earliest convenience.
 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, thank you for your cooperation and support.
 
                                          Sincerely,
 
                                          /s/ Ira A. Eichner

PROXY STATEMENT
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
October 8, 1997
 
SOLICITATION
 
This Proxy Statement is furnished to stockholders of AAR CORP., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company" or "AAR"), in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company to be used at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held in the Shareholders' Room
(21st Floor) of Bank of America Illinois, 231 S. LaSalle Street, Chicago,
Illinois, on Wednesday, October 8, 1997, at 3:00 P.M. (Chicago time), or any
adjournment thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement is first being
sent to holders of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share ("Common Stock") on or about August 28, 1997.
 
A proxy given in response to this solicitation may be revoked at any time prior
to the voting thereof by (i) sending written notice of revocation to the
Secretary of the Company, or (ii) delivering a later-dated proxy, or (iii)
attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Shares of Common Stock
represented by proxies that are properly executed and returned to the Company
will be voted in accordance with instructions on the proxy card. If no
instructions are specified, such shares will be voted (i) FOR Proposal 1, the
election of the three nominees for director designated by the Board of
Directors; (ii) FOR Proposal 2, the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan amendment
limiting to 300,000 shares the number of shares that may be granted to any
grantee in any 12-month period; (iii) FOR Proposal 3, approval of the
performance goals under the Long-Term Performance Restricted Stock Incentive
program for the Chief Executive Officer; (iv) FOR Proposal 4, the AAR CORP.
Section 162(m) Performance-Based Annual Cash Bonus program; and (v) upon any
other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting in the discretion
of the named proxies in accordance with their best judgment. In the event any
nominee is unavailable for election, which is not presently anticipated, shares
represented by valid proxies will be voted for such other person or persons in
the named proxies in accordance with their best judgment.
 
As provided in the Company's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan, shares held by the Dividend Reinvestment Agent for a participant will be
voted in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card received
representing such shares or otherwise as set forth above.
 
The cost of the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. Such costs
consist primarily of printing, postage and handling, including reimbursement to
banks, brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy material to their respective
principals. The Company has engaged D. F. King & Co., Inc., 77 Water Street, New
York, New York, to aid in the solicitation of proxies at a total estimated cost
of $7,500. D. F. King & Co., Inc. may solicit proxies by mail, personally, or by
telephone or telegraph. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by D. F. King
& Co., Inc. and by use of the mails, certain officers, directors and employees
of the Company may solicit proxies personally, or by telephone or telegraph,
without additional compensation.
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
QUORUM AND VOTING RIGHTS
 
On August 11, 1997, the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, 18,334,120 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on August 11,
1997 is entitled to one vote for every share of Common Stock held on the record
date. Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless the owner thereof is
present in person or by proxy. A quorum of stockholders is necessary to take
action at the Annual Meeting. The holders of a majority of the shares of Common
Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy will
constitute a quorum of stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Votes cast in person
or by proxy at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors of
election appointed for the Annual Meeting. The inspectors of election will treat
directions to withhold authority, abstentions and broker non-votes as shares
that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.
Directions to withhold authority will have no effect on the election of
directors, because directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded for purposes of determining
whether a matter has been approved, because they are not considered votes cast.
 
                                   PROPOSAL 1
 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company provide
that the Board of Directors shall consist of between three and fifteen
directors. The exact number of directors is fixed from time to time by the Board
of Directors and is presently set at ten.
 
The ten members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes: Class
I (3 directors), Class II (3 directors) and Class III (4 directors). One class
is elected each year for a three-year term. At the Annual Meeting, Erwin E.
Schulze, Joel D. Spungin, and David P. Storch will be nominated as directors to
serve in Class I until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in the year 2000 and
until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each of the nominees is
currently a director of the Company. Under Delaware law, the three nominees for
director who individually receive the greatest number of votes shall be elected
directors of the Company.

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), failed to file on a
timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the
most recent fiscal year or prior fiscal years, except as follows: (i) one Form 5
report covering two estate planning transactions which occurred in December,

Lee Stern, in April, 1997 (all five from 4 reports were filed initially by the
Company on behalf of these individuals via EDGAR electronic filing within the
deadline, but were not "accepted" by the SEC through such filing due to apparent
EDGAR computer format errors; pending resolution of the EDGAR computer formating
problems, backup hard copies of the Form 4 reports for these transactions were
filed by the Company on behalf of these individuals and received by the
Commission, but beyond the applicable SEC filing deadline).
 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
GENERAL
 
The Company's executive compensation program is structured and administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), which is
comprised of the five individuals listed below, all of whom are independent
directors of the Company.
 
The executive compensation program is designed to enable the Company to attract,
motivate and retain talented executives capable of achieving strategic business
initiatives and to reward them for their achievement. It is intended to
complement the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives and to
focus executives' efforts on fulfilling these objectives. The program consists
of three elements: (i) base salaries which are generally set at approximately
the median salary level of comparable positions in similar companies, adjusted
up or down to reflect individual capabilities and responsibilities and
experience levels; (ii) annual variable incentive opportunities paid in cash and
stock based on individual contribution and performance; and (iii) long-term
incentive opportunities, in the form of stock option/restricted stock awards.
 
Total compensation opportunities for each executive are intended to be
competitive with those offered by other companies competing for talent in the
Company's employment market. In designing and administering the individual
elements of the executive compensation program for each executive, the Committee
strives to balance short- and long-term incentive objectives and employ prudent
judgment in establishing base salary levels and performance criteria, evaluating
performance and determining actual incentive payments. To ensure competitiveness
and reasonableness of the Committee's compensation decisions, independent
compensation consulting firms are retained periodically to advise the Committee
in connection with both the design and implementation of the various elements of
the program and the level of individual executive participation. Generally, as
an executive's level of responsibility increases, a greater percentage of total
compensation is based on performance, and the mix of total compensation shifts
toward
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
stock, thereby aligning the long-term interest of senior executives with those
of stockholders. To encourage stock ownership in the Company by senior
executives, the Company has established guidelines for ownership of Common Stock
by senior management equal in value to 75% of salary, to be voluntarily achieved
over the next several years. An executive's progress towards achieving these
guidelines will be used by the Committee in making incentive stock compensation
decisions for the executive in the future.
 
Base salary levels of all elected corporate officers, including the Chief
Executive Officer, are reviewed annually and may be adjusted depending upon the
executive's responsibilities, assessed performance contribution, qualifications
and tenure in the Company and in the position held, and competitive salary
considerations relative to similar positions at selected companies in the
employment market from which the Company draws its executives.
 
Mr. Eichner, Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Storch, President and Chief
Executive Officer, each have an annual performance-based incentive bonus
opportunity of up to 100% of their respective base salary. That portion of Mr.
Storch's incentive bonus opportunity in excess of 80% of his base salary is
payable in restricted stock. The percentage incentive bonus opportunity for
other executive positions varies depending on their responsibility level, and
10% of any bonus paid is payable in restricted stock. As pertains to Mr. Eichner
and Mr. Storch, three-fourths of their respective incentive bonus opportunity is
based upon operating profit results and the remainder is based on asset
management results. Performance objectives for other executives are established
annually and the incentive opportunity varies depending on position.
 
The long-term incentive program consists of stock option and/or restricted stock
awards granted under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan approved by stockholders
in 1992. Mr. Storch is also eligible for a performance stock award based on
performance over a four year period pursuant to the terms of his Employment
Agreement.
 
Stock option awards typically expire 10 years from the date of grant or earlier
upon termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on
successive grant anniversary dates at the NYSE closing stock price on the date
of grant, and are accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals,
stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company. In
determining stock option and restricted stock awards, the Committee considers
the recipient's position and responsibilities in the Company, performance and
contributions made during the preceeding year, capabilities and potential for
future contribution to the Company, the number of options and awards previously
granted to the recipient and, for senior management, their progress toward
achieving the Company's guidelines for stock ownership by senior management.
Stock option and restricted stock awards for Mr. Storch are granted in
accordance with the terms of his Employment Agreement.
 
Restrictions imposed on restricted stock awards vary and are designed, among
other things, to encourage executives to stay with the Company and to maintain a
focus on long-term objectives of the Company. Typically, restricted stock grants
vest over five (5) years (20% each anniversary) or over seven (7) years (25% on
fourth anniversary, 25% on sixth anniversary and 50% on seventh anniversary);
restrictions on restricted stock used in lieu of cash to pay earned bonuses are
released over three (3) years (1/3 of such shares each anniversary). Typically,
awards (other than awards in lieu of cash to pay earned bonuses) are subject to
forfeiture if employment terminates for any reason during the award cycle.
During the award cycle the participant receives dividends on the restricted
shares and also has the right to vote the awarded shares.
 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
 
On October 9, 1996, David Storch, President and Chief Operating Officer of the
Company, was elected Chief Executive Officer of the Company replacing Ira
Eichner in that capacity, who continues as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Storch
also continues as President of the Company.
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
Competitive compensation analyses by independent consultants are used by the
Committee to ensure that the Chairman's and the Chief Executive Officer's base
salaries and total compensation are at an appropriate competitive level relative
to compensation for such positions at other companies in the relevant employment
market.
 
The Committee's action with respect to Mr. Eichner's and Mr. Storch's total
fiscal year 1997 compensation reflects consideration of the salary factors
discussed earlier, recognition of significant achievements during the year
including strong earnings growth above plan, expansion of capabilities through
development of new products and acquisitions, upgrading of existing investment
grade ratings on debt by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, an increase in
shareholder value during the year (share price up 40.1% and total market
capitalization up 59% or $210 million including the effects of a two million
share public offering), and the leadership role played in the performance of the
Company overall in maintaining the financial strength and liquidity of the
Company. Mr. Eichner's base salary and annual bonus opportunity has been
established at eighty percent (80%) of that of the President and Chief Executive
Officer.
 
The base salary level of Mr. Eichner, Chairman of the Board (and for part of the
fiscal year 1997, Chief Executive Officer), has been increased progressively
since 1955 to reflect his performance, leadership and responsibilities for
increasingly complex and diversified domestic and international operations as
the Company has expanded into new product lines and markets. In 1996, Mr.
Eichner's annual base salary was adjusted downward to $400,000 reflecting
relinquishment of his Chief Executive Officer duties.
 
Mr. Storch's annual base salary was increased to $500,000 in 1996 to reflect his
additional responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. As Chief
Operating Officer and newly named Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Storch's salary
has steadily increased during his 19 years with the Company including eight
years as Chief Operating Officer.
 
Mr. Eichner (who also served as Chief Executive Officer during part of fiscal
year 1997), was awarded an incentive bonus in 1997 equal to 100% of his base
salary reflecting achievement of (i) a 75% incentive opportunity benefit for
operating performance based on a substantial improvement over the prior year in
consolidated net sales (up 16.7%) and in net income (up 43.8%), and (ii) a 25%
incentive opportunity benefit for asset management based on improving the
balance sheet performance.
 
Mr. Storch was awarded an incentive bonus in 1997 equal to 100% of his base
salary in effect as of May 31, 1997 reflecting achievement of (i) a 75%
incentive opportunity benefit for operating performance based on a substantial
improvement over the prior year in consolidated net sales (up 16.7%) and in net
income (up 43.8%), and (ii) a 25% incentive opportunity benefit for asset
management based on improving the balance sheet performance.
 
Mr. Eichner, Mr. Storch, and other executive officers named in the Summary
Compensation Table below received the stock options and restricted stock awards
reflected in the table. The number of shares covered by each grant reflects
individual contributions and performance, as well as competitive industry
practices, in the view of the Committee; it also continues the Committee's
emphasis on executive share ownership and furthers the Company's objectives of
tying incentive compensation to performance and aligning executives' interests
with the interests of the Company's stockholders.
 
Long-term incentive awards and opportunities for Mr. Eichner and Mr. Storch were
changed from prior practices to reflect business objectives for the Company over
the coming years. It is the expectation of the Board of Directors that, based on
performance, Mr. Storch, as the Chief Executive Officer, should have the
opportunity to become a significant shareholder. In addition, the performance
measures that govern the opportunities should be both economic and shareholder
value related. Furthermore, such measures should be related to the Company's
industry and
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
investor communities. Pursuant to these objectives, Mr. Storch has the
opportunity to earn up to 360,000 shares at the completion of four years service
contingent upon the Company's performance versus (i) the Company's peer group
index and (ii) the S&P Composite 500 Index, for both return on total capital and
total return to shareholders. Finally, the Board may make awards of restricted
stock and options each year based on annual performance.
 
The tables which follow and accompanying footnotes and narrative reflect the
decisions covered by the above discussion.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
generally prevents the Company from claiming deduction for compensation in
excess of $1 million for any executives of the Company. This deduction
limitation, however, does not apply to performance-based compensation that
satisfies certain requirements under Section 162(m). The Committee has
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders
to structure compensation of executive officers so that compensation will not be
subject to the deduction limit to the extent that it can reasonably do so in a
manner that provides adequate incentives and allows the Company to attract and
retain qualified executives. However, the Committee has and may in the future
structure compensation arrangements that under certain circumstances may be
subject to the deduction limit.
 
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
 
This report of the Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by
any general statement incorporating this Proxy Statement into any filing under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 or under the Exchange Act (collectively, the
"Acts"), except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this

STOCK OPTIONS
 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding stock options
granted to the named executive officers in fiscal 1997 (the Company does not
grant stock appreciation rights). In addition, hypothetical gains or "option
spreads" that would exist for the respective options are shown based on assumed
rates of annual compound stock price appreciation of 0%, 5% and 10% required (in
the case of the 5% and 10% rates) by applicable regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission; these rates are for illustration purposes only and are
not a forecast of future appreciation. The Company did not use an alternative
formula for a grant date valuation, as the Company is not aware of any formula
which will determine, with reasonable accuracy, a present value based on future
unknown or volatile factors. The table also shows that the increase in potential
realizable value of such options, if any, will be less than 1% of the increase
in potential realizable value to the other stockholders.

<PAGE>
The Company's Retirement Plan covers all named executive officers. Benefits
under the Retirement Plan are determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the
Retirement Plan and take into consideration years of credited service, a
percentage of the participant's final average compensation (the five highest
consecutive calendar years of compensation out of the employee's last ten
calendar years of employment) and adjustments for social security "covered
compensation" which is an "offset" under the Retirement Plan. The term
"compensation" means cash compensation shown as income on an employee's Form
W-2, plus amounts contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan and reduced by certain
items specified in the Retirement Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
compensation for purposes of the Retirement Plan is subject to an annual
compensation limitation of $150,000 as adjusted from time to time by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue in accordance with applicable provisions of the
Code.
 
The aggregate salary and bonus compensation shown for the executive officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table above is the compensation currently
included for purposes of determining benefits under the Retirement Plan and
SKERP described below. The number of years of credited service under the Plan
(effective maximum is 20 years), is as follows: Mr. Eichner, 20 years; Mr.
Storch, 19 years; Mr. Pulsifer, 10 years; Mr. Romenesko, 16 years; and Mr.
Slapke, 13 years. Benefits under the Retirement Plan may be limited by
applicable laws or regulations.
 
SUPPLEMENTAL KEY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
The Company also provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain executives
and key employees under the SKERP. All of the named executives are participants
in the SKERP, except that Mr. Eichner's participation does not include
supplemental retirement benefits. The SKERP is designed to restore the
approximate amount of employer-provided benefits under the Company's Retirement
Plan lost as a result of Code limitations, including those limiting compensation
for purposes of benefit calculations. Such lost benefits restored under the
SKERP are determined in the same manner, using the same compensation data and
years of credited service, as retirement benefits are determined under the
Retirement Plan described above, subject to maximum compensation limits
established by the Company from time to time (presently $350,000 for key
employee participants and $500,000 for executive officer participants). The
SKERP also provides for aggregate retirement benefits at fifty percent (50%) of
final average compensation (as defined in the Retirement Plan) for certain
executive officers designated by the Compensation Committee (including four of
the named executive officers), subject to maximum compensation limits
established by the Company from time to time and reduced by certain items
specified in the Retirement Plan. The SKERP is unfunded and supplemental
retirement benefits thereunder are forfeited if the participant violates a
covenant not to compete set forth in the SKERP or his or her employment is
terminated for cause.
 
Mr. Eichner is also the beneficiary of a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
("SERP"). Annual retirement benefits under the SERP are equal to 80% of his
aggregate average of annual salary, bonus and long-term incentive cash payments
("cash compensation") for the three fiscal years during the ten fiscal years
preceding the date of his termination of active employment during which his cash
compensation was highest, subject to an offset for benefits received under the
Retirement Plan and certain reductions. Based on Mr. Eichner's cash compensation
history to date, it is estimated that he would receive an annual net of tax
retirement benefit of $551,000 upon retirement at age 66. The Company funds the
benefits through an irrevocable trust arrangement with a bank. The level of
funding is based on actuarial computations determined by an independent actuary.
The residual in the trust upon the death of Mr. Eichner will be paid to his
estate or designated beneficiaries.

Mr. Eichner has an agreement with the Company providing for employment in his
present capacity at a base compensation of $400,000 per year, effective October,
1996, or such increased amount as the Board may determine, and for retirement
benefits following termination of his full-time employment with the Company

remaining term of three years, but shall expire on the first to occur of his
death, disability, voluntary termination or attainment of age 68.
 
The Company has entered into an irrevocable trust agreement with The Northern
Trust Company as trustee to fund at certain dates the Company's obligations to
Mr. Eichner and his widow or other
 
                                       15

beneficiary under his employment agreement. The Company will pay bonuses to Mr.
Eichner (or his widow or other beneficiary) to provide for federal, state and
local income taxes incurred as a result of contributions to the trust and income
earned by trust assets. Mr. Eichner's estate or designated beneficiary(ies) will
receive any residual amounts in the trust after payment of all retirement and
other obligations under the trust agreement.
 
The Company has entered into an employment agreement ("Employment Agreement")
with Mr. Storch, designed to assure his continued services with the Company, at
a base compensation of $500,000 per year, effective October, 1996, or such
increased amount as the Board may determine. Mr. Storch's term of employment is
continuously extended so as to have a remaining term of three years, but shall
expire upon his death, disability, retirement or termination by the Company or
Mr. Storch pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement.
 
The Employment Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Mr. Storch's
employment, including: confidentiality and non-compete provisions, participation
in the Company's benefit plans, a severance payment upon termination of
employment by the Company for other than cause (as defined in the Employment
Agreement) prior to a change in control of the Company (as defined in the
Employment Agreement) equal to two times base salary then in effect, a severance
payment equal to three (3) times his average cash compensation (base salary plus
cash bonus) for the last two fiscal years of employment upon termination of
employment under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of
the Company, an incentive bonus opportunity of up to 100% of base salary subject
to annual financial targets approved by the Compensation Committee (any bonus in
excess of 80% of base salary is payable in three year restricted stock), and
long term incentive stock compensation consisting of an option grant of 200,000
shares, annual restricted stock awards of up to 15,000 shares each year for four
years in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, and 360,000 performance
shares to be granted at the completion of a four year performance period
contingent upon the Company's performance versus the Company's Peer Group index
and the S&P500 index, for both return on capital and total return to
shareholders.
 
The Company has entered into split dollar life insurance agreements with Mr.
Eichner and Mr. Storch. Under the agreements, the Company will fund the annual
insurance premiums for the policies subject to reimbursement from the cash value
or death benefit proceeds of the policies or by the individuals for any
deficiency in the event of early termination of the policies for any reason.
 
The Company has entered into severance agreements with certain key employees,
including all named executive officers other than Mr. Storch and Mr. Eichner.
The severance agreements are substantially identical, include confidentiality
and non-compete covenants, and provide for payment of compensation and certain
benefits in consideration thereof in the event of termination of employment for
other than cause, including a change in control of the Company. Severance equal
to one year base salary plus any earned incentive cash bonus will be paid upon
termination of employment for other than cause (as defined in the severance
agreement) prior to a change in control of the Company; severance equal to three
times average annual total compensation (base salary plus cash bonus) for the
last two fiscal years of employment will be paid upon termination of employment

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION
 
Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary
each receive an annual retainer of $28,000 payable only in Common Stock of the
Company, a fee of $1,750 for attendance at each meeting of the Board of
Directors or of any Board committee and reimbursement of expenses. The chairman
of each committee receives an additional $2,000 annual retainer. The Company
also provides each of its outside directors with group term life insurance
coverage of $200,000. In addition, under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan, each
outside director, upon becoming a director, automatically receives stock options
for 10,000 shares of the Common Stock which can be exercised in 25% increments
each anniversary grant date at the closing NYSE
 
                                       16
<PAGE>
price on the date of grant. Directors who are officers or employees of the
Company or any subsidiary receive no additional compensation for service on the
Board of Directors or any of its committees. The directors may elect to defer
receipt of their respective annual retainer and committee fees pursuant to the
Company's Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan.
 
The Company also has a Directors' Retirement Plan for its outside directors. The
Plan provides for a benefit to outside directors upon retirement on or after age
65, provided they have completed at least five years of service as a director.
Benefits are payable as a quarterly annuity in an amount equal to 25% of the
annual retainer fee payable by the Company to an active outside director.
Payment of benefits commences upon retirement and continues for a period equal
to the total number of years of the retired director's service as a director to
a maximum of ten years or death, whichever first occurs. The Directors'
Retirement Plan is unfunded. As of May 31, 1997, one former director was
receiving benefits under the Directors' Retirement Plan.
 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 
Mr. Jannotta, a director of the Company, is a Senior Director of William Blair &
Company, which from time to time has rendered investment banking services to the
Company, for which it has received customary compensation. In 1996, the Company
entered into an Underwriting Agreement pursuant to which William Blair & Company
served as co-manager of a public offering of securities on February 6, 1997.
Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company indemnified William Blair &
Company against certain liabilities, and, compensated William Blair & Company
for its services. Management believes the Underwriting Agreement was on terms as
favorable to the Company as if made with a non-affiliated party. It is
anticipated that the Company may engage William Blair & Company for additional
services in the future.
 
                                   PROPOSAL 2
 
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE AAR CORP. STOCK BENEFIT PLAN TO LIMIT TO 300,000
THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN TO ANY
GRANTEE DURING ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD
 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE PLAN
 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
generally precludes a publicly traded company from taking a federal income tax
deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the company's chief
executive officer or any of the four next highest paid executive officers,
subject to several exceptions, including an exception for compensation paid
under a stockholder-approved plan that is "performance-based" within the meaning
of Section 162(m). Compensation attributable to a stock option or stock
appreciation right is deemed to be performance-based if, among other things, the
underlying plan, as approved by the stockholders, includes a limit on the number
of shares for which stock options or stock appreciation rights may be granted to
any one person during a specified period. The Board of Directors believes that
it is in the best interests of the Company to ensure, to the extent possible,
the full deductibility of compensation attributable to stock options ("Options")
and "limited rights" (as defined below) granted under the AAR CORP. Stock
Benefit Plan (the "Plan"). Accordingly, the Board has unanimously adopted,
subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to the Plan which provides that
the maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Options or
limited rights, or any combination thereof, may be granted to any one person
under the Plan within any 12-month period shall not exceed 300,000 shares. If
this proposal is not approved by the stockholders, the Company's named executive
officers will receive compensation pursuant to the terms of applicable
employment agreements or under alternative compensation arrangements approved by
the Committee in its discretion.
 
                                       17
<PAGE>
SUMMARY OF THE PLAN
 
The Plan was approved by the Company's stockholders in 1992, and an amendment to
the Plan was approved by the stockholders in 1996. The Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors administers the Plan and has the authority to determine
the key employees to whom awards are to be granted under the Plan, the term and
other terms and conditions of each award, the applicable vesting schedule, and
the number of shares of Common Stock covered by an award. As of May 31, 1997,
107 employees were eligible to receive awards under the Plan. In fiscal 1997,
107 employees received such awards.
 
As of June 30, 1997, a total of 111,746 shares were available for issuance under
the Plan. On January 1 of each calendar year prior to December 31, 2001, an
additional number of shares equal to 2% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock as of such date becomes available for issuance. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no more than 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be subject to
incentive stock options granted under the Plan.
 
Under the Plan, the Company may grant the following types of awards:
 
OPTIONS.  Options may be either non-qualified stock options or incentive stock
options. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the exercise price must equal
the fair market value per share of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
Payment of the exercise price may be made in cash, in shares of Common Stock, or
as otherwise authorized by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.
Subject to certain limited exceptions, including a change in control of the
Company (as defined in the Plan), non-qualified stock options may not be
exercised before the first anniversary date of grant. Each Option will expire on
the date fixed by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant but in no
event later than the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. In its discretion,
the Compensation Committee, may grant an additional Option (a "Reload Option")
for the number of shares used by the grantee to pay the exercise price of the
original Option, provided that such Reload Option must be subject to the same
terms as the original Option except that the exercise price of a Reload Option
must be equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time that the
original Option is exercised. The Plan also provides for an automatic grant of a
non-qualified stock option to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock, exercisable
over four years, to each non-employee director on the date such person becomes a
director of the Company.
 
LIMITED RIGHTS.  The Compensation Committee may also grant to any key employee
who is the holder of an Option under the Plan the right to surrender all or a
portion of the Option following a change in control of the Company (as defined
in the Plan) in return for an amount of cash determined by the Compensation
Committee at the time of grant but in no event greater than the excess of the
fair market value of the shares covered by the Option over the aggregate
exercise price (a "Limited Right"). No Limited Right will be exercisable until
six months after the date of grant or on such later date on which the Option to
which it relates becomes exercisable.
 
RESTRICTED STOCK.  The Compensation Committee may also grant awards of
restricted stock to key employees, either separately from or in tandem with, the
grant of an Option. Subject to certain limited exceptions (including a change in
control of the Company), such restrictions may not lapse sooner than the first
or later than the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
 
Information relating to awards made in fiscal 1997 under the Plan to the
executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table is presented in the
various tables under the caption "Executive Compensation and Other Information."
In addition, 203,000 Options at an average exercise price of $24.125 per share
were granted to all non-officer employees as a group. Awards to be made in the
future under the Plan are not yet determinable since they are discretionary
(other than the automatic grants to non-employee directors). On July 31, 1997,
the last reported sales price for the Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange was $35.75 per share.
 
                                       18
<PAGE>
The Board of Directors may terminate, suspend or modify the Plan, without the
authorization of the stockholders, to the extent allowed by law. No termination,
suspension or modification of the Plan may adversely affect any rights of a
holder of an award granted under the Plan before the date of such termination,
suspension or modification.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
Neither non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, nor restricted
stock awards require the holder to recognize income, or entitle the Company to a
deduction, at the time of grant.
 
Upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the holder will recognize
ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
option stock as of the date of exercise over the exercise price. Upon the
vesting of a restricted stock award, the holder will realize ordinary income in
an amount equal to the fair market value of the restricted stock at such time. A
holder may elect to recognize ordinary income on the fair market value of the
restricted stock at the date of the award, and thus recognize capital gain on
the subsequent sale of the stock in an amount equal to the excess of the fair
market value of the stock at the date of vesting over the fair market value at
the date of the award.
 
Incentive stock options are not ordinarily subject to taxation until the holder
sells the option stock, although the excess of the fair market value of the
option stock over the exercise price is a tax preference item subject to
alternative minimum taxation at the time of exercise. When stock acquired
through exercise of an incentive stock option is sold at least two years after
grant and at least one year after exercise, the holder recognizes as capital
gain or loss the difference between the sale proceeds of the option stock and
the exercise price. If these holding periods are not met, the holder will
recognize ordinary income on the excess of the sale proceeds over the exercise
price.
 
Subject to Section 162(m), the Company is entitled to a deduction when and to
the extent the holder recognizes ordinary income upon the vesting of a
restricted stock award or the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, provided
the Company complied with certain withholding requirements. In the case of an
incentive stock option, the Company is not entitled to a deduction where the
holder recognizes capital gain; the Company is, however, entitled to a deduction
when and to the extent the holder recognizes ordinary income upon sale of the
option stock within either of the two previously mentioned holding periods.
 
VOTE REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL
 
The proposed amendment to the Plan must be approved by a majority of the shares
of Common Stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the 1997
Annual Meeting.
 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED
AMENDMENT TO THE AAR CORP. STOCK BENEFIT PLAN.
 
                                   PROPOSAL 3
 
APPROVAL OF PERFORMANCE GOALS UNDER THE PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE
PROGRAM FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
 
BACKGROUND
 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally
precludes a publicly traded company from taking a tax deduction for compensation
in excess of $1 million paid to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, subject
to several exceptions, including an exception for compensation paid under a plan
having stockholder-approved "performance-based" goals within the meaning of
Section 162(m).
 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has unanimously adopted
performance goals under a Long-Term Performance Restricted Stock Incentive Bonus
program for David P.
 
                                       19
<PAGE>
Storch, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, subject to stockholder approval
of such performance goals. This program is designed to (i) tie a significant
portion of the total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the creation
of shareholder value relative to other investments and not simply on the basis
of stock price or stock market movement, (ii) provide incentive compensation
opportunities contingent upon achieving better than average economic performance
as compared with peers and the general market, (iii) provide an incentive
opportunity in the form of performance-based restricted stock that results in
significant stock ownership, the value of which is contingent upon sustained
performance; and (iv) to the extent possible, consistent with the Company's
performance and compensation objectives, qualify such compensation as
"performance-based" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
so that the Company will be entitled to a tax deduction on the payment of such
awards.
 
LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE BONUS PERFORMANCE GOALS
 
Under Mr. Storch's Long-Term Performance Restricted Stock Incentive Bonus
program, based on achievement of specified goals, Mr. Storch may earn up to
360,000 restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock in accordance with a
performance unit matrix covering a four year performance period commencing July
9, 1996, the date of his appointment as Chief Executive Officer. The number of
restricted shares to be awarded, if any, will be determined at the end of the
performance period based on achievement of the following specified performance
goals and performance unit matrix:
 
    A.  The Company's cumulative percentage Total Return to Shareholders as
compared to the S&P 500 Composite Index Total Return to Shareholders; and
 
    B.  The Company's cumulative percentage Total Return to Shareholders as
compared to its Peer Group Composite Index Total Return to Shareholders; and
 
    C.  The Company's average Return on Capital as compared to the S&P 500
Composite Index average Return on Capital; and
 
    D.  The Company's average Return on Capital as compared to the Company's
Peer Group Composite Index average Return on Capital.
 
For purposes of this program (i) "Total Return to Shareholders" means the
cumulative share price appreciation plus dividends (reinvested); (ii) "Peer
Group Composite Index" means the index selected by the Company from time to time
for performance comparisons in the Company's annual proxy statement pursuant to
applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations; and (iii) "Return on
Capital" means earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by Total
Capital (debt plus equity minus cash).
 
Performance units will be earned in accordance with the following performance
unit matrix:

        will be 80% of the median of the S&P 500 and 60th percentile of the Peer
        Group. Results between the amounts shown on the schedule will be

One share of restricted stock will be awarded for each performance unit earned
under the above performance unit matrix, subject to a maximum total dollar value
of $12,690,000 based on the New York Stock Exchange closing price for the
Company's Common Stock on July 9, 2000. The shares will be restricted for three
years after July 9, 2000, with fifty percent (50%) vesting on the first
anniversary date of the award and fifty percent (50%) vesting on the third
anniversary date of the award. In the event Mr. Storch's employment with the
Company is terminated within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in
Control of the Company, as that term is defined in Mr. Storch's Employment
Agreement, occurring prior to July 9, 2000 pursuant to the Change-in-Control
provisions of Mr. Storch's Employment Agreement, the above stated dollar value
limit will be removed and 360,000 shares will be awarded and such compensation
will not be deductible under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions.
 
If this proposal is approved by the stockholders, Mr. Storch's Employment
Agreement will be amended to reflect the approved goals and long-term restricted
stock incentive award opportunity described in this proposal in lieu of the
existing performance share award opportunity presently provided for in his
Employment Agreement. If this proposal is not approved by the stockholders, Mr.
Storch will receive compensation pursuant to the terms of his Employment
Agreement described in the Employment and Other Agreements section of this Proxy
Statement, or other alternative compensation arrangements approved by the Board
and acceptable to Mr. Storch.
 
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION
 
Mr. Storch's Long-Term Performance Restricted Stock Incentive Program will be
administered by the Board's Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), consisting
of at least two non-employee directors, each of whom is intended to qualify as
an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
Under present federal income tax law, Mr. Storch will realize ordinary income in
the year restrictions are released in an amount equal to the fair market value
of the restricted shares released. The Company will receive a deduction for the
amount constituting ordinary income to the participant, provided that the
requirements of Section 162(m) which limits the deductibility of non-performance
related compensation paid to certain corporate executives are satisfied.
 
VOTE REQUIRED
 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in
person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to
approve the performance goals under the Long-Term Performance Restricted Stock
Incentive program for Mr. Storch.
 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE
PERFORMANCE GOALS UNDER THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED STOCK INCENTIVE
PROGRAM FOR MR. STORCH.
 
                                   PROPOSAL 4
 
APPROVAL OF THE AAR CORP. SECTION 162(M) PERFORMANCE BASED ANNUAL CASH BONUS
PROGRAM
 
BACKGROUND
 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally
precludes a publicly traded company from taking a tax deduction for compensation
in excess of $1 Million paid to a company's chief executive officer or any of
the company's four next highest paid executive officers, subject to several
exceptions, including an exception for compensation paid under a stockholder-
approved plan that is "performance-based" within the meaning of Section 162(m).
 
                                       21
<PAGE>
The Company's Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee believe that, as
a matter of general policy, the Company's incentive compensation plans should be
structured to ensure the full deductibility of compensation under Section
162(m), but that the Compensation Committee should reserve the right to
establish separate incentive compensation arrangements for otherwise covered
executive officers that may not meet Section 162(m) deductibility requirements
if it determines, in its sole discretion, that doing so would be in the
Company's best interests.
 
To come within the Section 162(m) exception for "performance-based" plans, the
Compensation Committee has established a Section 162(m) Performance Based Annual
Cash Bonus program ("Section 162(m) Bonus Program") for certain Company
officers, subject to the approval of such program by the Company's stockholders
at the Company's 1997 annual meeting.
 
The purpose of the Section 162(m) Bonus Program is (i) to retain and motivate
key senior executives of the Company who have been designated as participants in
the Section 162(m) Performance Based Annual Cash Bonus Program for a given
fiscal year, by providing them with the opportunity to earn annual bonus awards
that are based on the extent to which specified performance goals for such year
have been achieved or exceeded and (ii) to structure annual bonus opportunities
in a way that will qualify the awards made as "performance-based" for purposes
of Section 162(m) so that the Company will be entitled to a tax deduction on the
payment of such incentive awards to such employees.
 
Bonus eligible officers and other key employees not designated as participants
in the Section 162(m) Bonus Program for any given year will generally be
eligible for coverage under one of the Company's other annual bonus plans and
arrangements.
 
The Compensation Committee believes that annual cash bonuses serve as an
incentive to focus on the annual goals that are necessary to preserve and grow
shareholder wealth. As part of its pay for performance policy and its long
history of maintaining the strong balance sheet necessary to survive and thrive
in our industry, the Compensation Committee establishes explicit goals for key
members of management that will provide competitive opportunities upon the
achievement of the pre-established goals. If this proposal is not approved by
the stockholders, the Company's officers and key employees may receive annual
cash bonus awards in the discretion of the Compensation Committee under
alternative compensation arrangements approved by the Committee.
 
SECTION 162(M) BONUS PROGRAM OPPORTUNITIES AND AWARDS
 
Within the first 90 days of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee will
establish specific goals for the Chairman and CEO and certain other executive
officers of the Company (as appropriate in the Compensation Committee's
discretion) that will govern the payment of their annual cash bonuses for that
fiscal year. These goals will focus on two categories: income and balance sheet
management. The importance and weighting of these two categories will be
established each year by the Compensation Committee. Under the category of
balance sheet management, the Compensation Committee will establish goals that
will include one or several of the following criteria: shareholder equity,
long-term debt to capital ratio, investment rating, debt coverage, cash flow or
return on invested capital. Under the category of income, the Compensation
Committee will establish goals that will include one or several of the
following: pre-tax income, earnings per share, net income. Upon achievement of
target goals, a participant may earn up to 100% of such participant's salary
(not to exceed $4 million in any year). The amount actually earned will depend
on each participant's position and actual performance versus pre-established
goals. After the acceptance of audited financial statements by the Board, the
Compensation Committee will certify the degree of achievement for each criteria
and the corresponding bonus payment for each Section 162(m) Bonus Program
participant.
 
                                       22
<PAGE>
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION
 
The Section 162(m) Bonus Program will be administered by the Compensation
Committee, consisting of at least two non-employee directors, each of whom is
intended to qualify as an "outside director" within the meaning of Section
162(m) of the Code. The Section 162(m) Bonus Program will be administered by the
Compensation Committee which will, among other things, designate participants,
establish performance goals, and interpret and administer the Section 162(m)
Bonus Program as it deems necessary or advisable.
 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
 
The Compensation Committee may terminate the Section 162(m) Bonus Program, in
whole or part, and may amend the Section 162(m) Bonus Program from time to time
provided (i) that, without the participant's written consent, no such amendment
or termination shall adversely affect the annual bonus rights (if any) of any
already designated participant for a given fiscal year once the participant
designations and performance goals for such year have been announced and (ii)
that the Compensation Committee shall be authorized to make any amendments
necessary to comply with applicable regulatory requirements (including, without
limitation, Section 162(m)). Section 162(m) Bonus Program amendments will
require stockholder approval only if required under Section 162(m).
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
Under present federal income tax law, participants will realize ordinary income
equal to the amount of the award received in the year of receipt. The Company
shall receive a deduction for the amount constituting ordinary income to the
participant, provided that the requirements of Section 162(m) which limits the
deductibility of non-performance related compensation paid to certain corporate
executives are satisfied.
 
VOTE REQUIRED
 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in
person or by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting is required to approve the
Section 162(m) Bonus Program.
 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE
SECTION 162(M) BONUS PROGRAM.
 
OTHER MATTERS
 
Management knows of no other matters which are to be brought before this Annual
Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting,
it is intended that the persons voting the proxies will vote them in accordance
with their best judgment on such other matters.
 
INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
The Company's Board of Directors, upon recommendation of its Audit Committee,
has selected KPMG Peat Marwick as its independent public accountants for the
fiscal year ending May 31, 1998. Representatives of that firm are expected to be
present at the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they
so desire and to be available to respond to appropriate questions.

                               STOCK BENEFIT PLAN*

1.   PURPOSE AND ELIGIBILITY

     AAR CORP. adopted the AAR CORP. 1983 Incentive Stock Plan, effective April
12, 1983, as amended and restated effective July 22, 1986 and as subsequently
further amended from time to time.  AAR CORP. now further amends, restates and
renames such plan the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan.  This Plan is adopted to
encourage officers and other key employees of the Company who have executive,
managerial, supervisory or professional responsibilities and non-employee
members of the Board to increase their investment in the Company and to provide
additional opportunities to such persons to share in the success of the Company.
The opportunity so provided is intended to foster in Grantees a strong incentive
to put forth maximum effort for the continued success and growth of the Company,
to aid in retaining individuals who put forth such efforts, and to assist in
attracting the best available individuals in the future.

     Non-Employee Directors shall participate in the Plan through automatic
grants of NSOs pursuant to Section 5 hereof.  Key Employees who have been
selected by the Committee to receive an Award shall participate in the Plan. 
The Committee shall determine, within the limits of the express provisions of
the Plan, those Key Employees to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards
shall be granted.  In making a determination concerning the granting of Awards,
the Committee may take into account the nature of the services the Key Employees
have rendered or that the Committee expects they will render, their present and
potential contributions to the success of the business, the number of years of
effective service they are expected to have and such other factors as the
Committee in its sole discretion shall deem relevant.  The Committee shall also
determine, with respect to Awards to Key Employees, the number of Shares to be
subject to each such Award; the type of Awards (Restricted Stock, Options or
Limited Rights); the type of Options (ISO or NSO); the duration of each Option;
the exercise price under each Option; the time or times within which (during the
Term of the Option) all or portions of each Option may be exercised; whether
cash, Shares, Options or other property may be accepted in full or partial
payment upon

                                       7

<PAGE>

be the same, even as to Awards made at the same time.  The Committee's 
actions in making Awards and fixing their size, Term, and other terms and 
conditions shall be conclusive on all persons.

     3.3  The Committee shall have the sole responsibility for construing and 
interpreting the Plan, for establishing and amending such rules and

through any Grantee or otherwise.

times and places as it may determine.  A majority of its members shall

a majority of its members. Any determination reduced to writing and signed by 
all members shall be fully as effective as if it had been made by a majority 
vote at a meeting duly called and held.  The Committee may appoint a 
Secretary, who need not be a member of the Committee, and may make such rules 
and regulations for the conduct of its business as it shall deem advisable.

     3.5  No member of the Committee shall be liable, in the absence of bad 
faith, for any act or omission with respect to his service on the Committee.

4.   SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

     4.1  The total number of Shares that may be available for Awards under 
the Plan at any date shall be the aggregate of (1) the sum of 0.9% of the 
total number of issued and outstanding

                                       8

<PAGE>

Shares on each of January 1, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, plus (2) the sum of 
2% of the total number of issued and outstanding Shares on January 1, 1996 
and on January 1st of each subsequent calendar year commencing within the 
Applicable Period and on or prior to the date the total number of Shares is 
determined, minus (3) the total number of Shares that have been subject to 
Awards granted under the Plan after July 16, 1992; provided, however, that 
the number of Shares available pursuant to this sentence shall be increased 
by the number of Shares (i) delivered by any Grantee, or (ii) withheld by the 
Company, pursuant to Section 14 or 20 of the Plan in connection with the 
exercise of an Option.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, Applicable 
Period shall be the ten year period commencing on January 1, 1992 and ending 
on December 31, 2001.  The aforementioned total number of Shares shall be 
adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2 hereof.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total number of Shares that may be subject 
to ISOs under the Plan shall be 1,000,000 Shares, adjusted in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 4.2 hereof.  A Share subject to an Option and its 
related tandem Restricted Stock Award shall only be counted once.  The Shares 
so issued may be Shares held in the treasury or Shares which are authorized 
but unissued, as elected by the Board.  Any Shares subject to issuance upon 
exercise of Options but which are not issued because of a surrender, lapse, 
expiration, cancellation or termination of any such Option, or which have 
been issued in connection with Restricted Stock Awards that are subsequently 
canceled or forfeited to the extent consistent with applicable law, rules and 
regulations, shall once again be available for issuance in satisfaction of 
Awards.  Shares in respect of which Limited Rights are exercised shall not 
thereafter be available for issuance in satisfaction of Awards.

     4.2  Any increase or decrease in the number of outstanding Shares of the 
Company occurring through stock splits, stock dividends, stock 
consolidations, spin-offs, other distributions of assets to shareholders, or 
assumptions or conversions of outstanding Awards due to an acquisition after 
the adoption of the Plan shall be reflected proportionately in an increase or 
decrease in the aggregate number of Shares then available for the grant of 
Awards under the Plan or becoming available through the termination, 
surrender or lapse of Awards previously granted but

                                       9

<PAGE>

unexercised, and in the number of Shares subject to Awards then outstanding; 
and a proportionate reduction or increase shall be made in the per share 
option price to any outstanding Options.  Any fractional shares resulting 
from such adjustments shall be eliminated.  If changes in capitalization 
other than those considered above shall occur, the Board shall make such 
adjustment in the number or class of shares as to which Awards may thereafter 
be granted, in the number and class of shares remaining subject to Awards 
then outstanding and in the per share option price as the Board in its 
discretion may consider appropriate, and all such adjustments shall be 
conclusive upon all persons.

     4.3  The total number of Shares with respect to which Options or Limited 
Rights, or any combination thereof, may be granted under the Plan to any 
Grantee during any 12 month period shall not exceed 300,000 Shares.

5.   GRANTS TO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

     5.1  Grants

     All Awards to Non-Employee Directors shall be automatic and 
non-discretionary.  Each individual who is a Non-Employee Director on the 
effective date of the Plan shall automatically receive an Award, on the 
effective date, consisting of a NSO to purchase 10,000 Shares.  Each 
individual who becomes a Non-Employee Director after the effective date of 
the Plan shall automatically receive an Award, on the date he or she becomes 
a Non-Employee Director, consisting of an NSO to purchase 10,000 Shares.  In 
any event, a maximum of 10,000 Shares, as adjusted pursuant to subsection 
4.2, granted to a Non-Employee Director under this Plan or any other plan of 
the Company may be outstanding at any time.  The preceding formula for Awards 
to Non-Employee Directors shall not be changed more than once in any 
six-month period.

     5.2  NSOs

     The per share exercise price of each such NSO granted to a Non-Employee 
Director shall be 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date 
of grant.  Each such NSO shall be exercisable in installments in accordance 
with the following schedule:

                                       10

<PAGE>

          (a)  A maximum of 25% of the total Shares covered by the NSO may be
     exercised after the first anniversary of the date of grant;

          (b)  A maximum of 50% of the total Shares covered by the NSO and not
     previously purchased upon exercise of the NSO may be exercised after the
     second anniversary of the date of grant;

          (c)  A maximum of 75% of the total Shares covered by the NSO and not
     previously purchased upon exercise of the NSO may be exercised after the
     third anniversary of the date of grant; and 

          (d)  100% of the total Shares covered by the NSO and not previously
     purchased upon exercise of the NSO may be exercised after the fourth
     anniversary of the date of grant,

and shall expire on the date ten years after the date of grant.

6.   GRANTS OF OPTIONS TO KEY EMPLOYEES

     6.1  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may from time to 
time grant Options, which may be Non-Qualified Stock Options or Incentive 
Stock Options, to Key Employees.  Unless otherwise expressly provided at the 
time of the grant, Options granted under the Plan will not be ISOs.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, outstanding NSOs may be converted to ISOs at 
the discretion of the Committee in accordance with, and to the extent, 
allowed by law.

     6.2  Each Option shall be evidenced by a written Option Agreement
specifying the type of Option granted, the Option exercise price, the terms for
payment of the exercise price, the duration of the Option, the number of Shares
to which the Option pertains and the terms of any related Restricted Stock
Award.  An Option Agreement may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, also
contain a vesting schedule, a non-competition agreement, a confidentiality
provision, provisions for forfeiture and such restrictions, conditions and other
terms as the Committee shall

                                       11

<PAGE>

determine in its sole discretion.  Option Agreements need not be identical.  

     6.3  Each Option shall expire and all rights to purchase Shares 
thereunder shall cease on the date fixed by the Committee in the Option 
Agreement, which shall not be later than the tenth anniversary of the date on 
which the Option was granted, except as otherwise required under Section 7.4 
hereof.  Further, if provided in the Option Agreement, any Option granted to 
a Key Employee pursuant to the Plan shall expire and all rights to purchase 
Shares thereunder shall cease, if (i) the Key Employee violates a 
non-competition, confidentiality or employment agreement, any Company policy, 
or any other conditions set forth in the Option Agreement or in a separate 
document, or (ii) the Key Employee's employment terminates as provided in 
Section 12.

     6.4  Each Option shall become exercisable at the time, and for the 
number of Shares, fixed by the Committee in the Option Agreement.  Except to 
the extent otherwise provided in or pursuant to Section 13, or in the proviso 
to this sentence, no Option shall become exercisable as to any Shares prior 
to the first anniversary of the date on which the Option was granted; 
provided that (i) the Committee may provide, at the time of grant or 
subsequently that an Option granted to a person who is or becomes subject to 
taxation under any applicable law that would tax such person upon the grant 
of such Option, shall be exercisable from and after the date of grant or (ii) 
the Committee, in its discretion, shall have the power to accelerate the 
dates for exercise of any or all Options, or any part thereof, granted to a 
Key Employee under the Plan.

     6.5  In the discretion of the Committee, the grant of any Option may be
accompanied by a Reload Option.  A Reload Option may be granted to a Grantee who
is an Option holder and who satisfies all or part of the purchase price of the
Option with Shares.  The Reload Option represents an additional Option to
acquire the same number of Shares as is used by the Grantee to pay for the
original Option.  A Reload Option is subject to all of the same terms and
conditions as the original Option except that (1) the purchase price of the
Shares subject to the Reload Option will be determined at the time the original
Option is exercised and (2)

                                       12

<PAGE>

such Reload Option will conform to all provisions of the Plan at the time the 
original Option is exercised.

7.   REQUIRED TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

     7.1    Except as provided in subsection 7.4, the per Share exercise 
price of each ISO shall be at least 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of 
the Shares at the time such ISO is granted.

     7.2  The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined with respect to each 
Incentive Stock Option at the time such Option is granted) of the Shares with 
respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time 
by an individual during any calendar year (under all incentive stock option 
plans of the Company and its parent and subsidiary corporations) shall not 
exceed $100,000.  If the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time 
of grant) of the stock subject to an Option, which first becomes exercisable 
in any calendar year exceeds the limitation of this subsection, so much of 
the Option that does not exceed the applicable dollar limit shall be an ISO 
and the remainder shall be an NSO; but in all other respects, the original 
Option Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

     7.3  As used in this Section 7, the words "parent" and "subsidiary" 
shall have the meanings given to them in Section 425(e) and 425(f) of the 
Code.

     7.4  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Incentive 
Stock Option is granted to an individual who owns stock possessing more than 
10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the 
Company or of its parent or subsidiary corporation, within the meaning of 
Section 422(b)(6) of the Code, (i) the purchase price of each Share subject 
to Option shall be not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of the 
Share on the date the Option is granted, and (ii) the Option shall expire and 
all rights to purchase Shares thereunder shall cease no later than the fifth 
anniversary of the date the Option was granted.

     7.5  No ISOs may be granted under the Plan after July 15, 2002.

                                       13

<PAGE>

8.   REQUIRED TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS

     Each NSO granted to a Key Employee shall be in such form and subject to 
such restrictions and conditions and other terms as the Committee may 
determine at the time of grant, subject to the general provisions of the 
Plan, the applicable Option Agreement, and the following specific rules:

     8.1  The number of Shares subject to each NSO and the per share exercise 
price of each NSO shall be 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Shares 
on the date the NSO is granted.  In no event may the exercise price be less 
than the par value of the Shares subject to such NSO.

     8.2  The Committee shall specify at the time each NSO is granted, the 
duration of each NSO and the time or times within which (during the term of 
the NSO) all or portions of each NSO may be exercised, except to the extent 
that other terms of exercise are specifically provided by other provisions of 
the Plan, and such provisions shall be specified in the applicable Option 
Agreement.

9.   RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS TO KEY EMPLOYEES

     9.1  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may also grant to 
Key Employees Restricted Stock Awards from time to time.  Restricted Stock 
may be granted to a Key Employee either separately from, or in tandem with, 
the grant of an Option to the Key Employee.  In the case of Restricted Stock 
granted in tandem with the grant of an Option:  (i) the exercise of the 
Option shall cause the forfeiture to the Company of the Restricted Stock 
related to the Option, or portion thereof that is exercised; and (ii) the 
lapse of restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock shall cause the 
expiration of the unexercised Option, or portion thereof, related to such 
Restricted Stock.  Restricted Stock not granted in tandem with the grant of 
an Option shall have no effect on, and shall not be affected by, the exercise 
of any Option by the holder of such Restricted Stock.

     9.2  The terms and conditions of any such Award, including restrictions on
transfer or on the ability of the Grantee to make elections with respect to the
taxation of the Award without the

                                       14

<PAGE>

consent of the Committee, shall be determined by the Committee at the time of 
grant. Except as provided in Sections 9.1, 9.6, 11, 12 and 13, no such 
restrictions shall lapse earlier than the first, or later than the tenth, 
anniversary of the date of the Award.

     9.3  Restricted Stock Awards issued under the Plan shall be evidenced by 
written Restricted Stock Agreements which shall specify whether such 
Restricted Stock is issued separate from, or in tandem with, the grant of an 
Option, the number of Shares issuable under the Restricted Stock Award 
evidenced thereby, and such other provisions as the Committee, in its sole 
discretion, may determine.

     9.4  The number of Shares granted under a Restricted Stock Award shall 
be issued to the Grantee thereof on the date of grant of such Award or as 
soon as may be practicable thereafter.  Shares issued pursuant to Restricted 
Stock Awards shall be duly issued or transferred, and a certificate or 
certificates for such Shares shall be issued in the Grantee's name. Subject 
to the restrictions set forth in the related Restricted Stock Agreement, the 
Grantee shall thereupon be a stockholder with respect to all the Shares 
represented by such certificate or certificates and shall have all the rights 
of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote 
such Shares and to receive dividends and other distributions paid with 
respect to such Shares.  In aid of such restrictions, certificates for Shares 
awarded hereunder, together with a suitably executed stock power signed by 
each Grantee, shall be held by a nominee of the Company for the account of 
such Grantee until the restrictions under the related Restricted Stock 
Agreement lapse pursuant to such Agreement or such Shares are theretofore 
forfeited to the nominee of the Company as provided by the Plan or the 
Agreement.

     9.5  At the Committee's option, the Restricted Stock Agreement may provide
that any Shares of Restricted Stock granted to a Key Employee pursuant to the
Plan shall be forfeited to the Company if, among other reasons, (i) the Key
Employee violates a non-competition, confidentiality or employment agreement,
any Company policy, or any other condition set forth in the Restricted Stock
Agreement or in a separate document, (ii) the Key Employee's employment with the
Company terminates prior to the date or dates for expiration of the forfeiture

her Restricted Stock Agreement, which date shall not be earlier than the 
first anniversary of such grant, (iii) the Key Employee's employment with the 
Company terminates for Cause, or (iv) there occurs a violation of any 
provision of the applicable Restricted Stock Agreement.  A forfeiture of 
Restricted Stock pursuant to this subsection 9.5 shall occur immediately 
following the mailing of written notice to the Key Employee.  Thereafter, the 
Secretary of the Company shall promptly cancel Shares of Restricted Stock 
that are forfeited to the Company.

     9.6  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Key Employee's employment 
terminates, or (ii) upon a Change in Control, any restrictions of this 
Section 9 or in any Restricted Stock Agreement shall lapse as provided in 
Sections 12 and 13.  

     9.7  The Committee may prescribe such other restrictions and conditions 
and other terms applicable to the Shares of Restricted Stock issued to a Key 
Employee under the Plan that are neither inconsistent with nor prohibited by 
the Plan or any Restricted Stock Agreement, including, without limitation, 
terms providing for a lapse of the restrictions of this Section 9, provided 
they are set forth in the applicable Restricted Stock Agreement, in 
installments.

10.  LIMITED RIGHTS

     10.1 The Committee may, in its discretion, grant a Limited Right to a 
Key Employee who is the holder of an Option, either at the time the Option is 
granted or at any time after the Option is granted and until one day prior to 
the date that is sixth months prior to the end of the Term of the Option, so 
long as the grant is made during the period in which grants of Limited Rights 
may be made under the Plan.

     10.2 Each Limited Right shall be for such Term, and shall be subject to 
such other terms and conditions, as the Committee shall impose at the time of 
grant. The terms and conditions may include limitations on the time within 
which and the extent to which such Limited Right shall be exercisable, and 
limitations on the amount of appreciation which may be recognized with regard 
to such Limited Right.The terms and conditions shall be reflected in a 
written agreement between the Company and the Grantee pursuant to

                                       16

<PAGE>

which the Limited Right is awarded.  This agreement shall either be part of 
an Option Agreement or be a separately executed agreement.

     10.3 No Limited Right shall become exercisable until the date sixth 
months after it was granted, or such later date that the Option to which it 
relates becomes exercisable.

     10.4 Upon exercise of a Limited Right, the Option, or portion thereof, with
respect to which such Right is exercised shall be surrendered and shall not
thereafter be exercisable.

11.  NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF RIGHTS

     No rights under any Award shall be transferable otherwise than by will 
or the laws of descent and distribution, and the rights and the benefits, of 
any such Award, may be exercised and received, respectively, during the 
lifetime of the Grantee only by him or her.

     Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, a Grantee, at 
any time prior to his death, may assign all or any portion of an Award 
granted to him (other than an ISO) to (i) his spouse or lineal descendant, 
(ii) the trustee of a trust for the primary benefit of his spouse or lineal 
descendant, (iii) a partnership of which his spouse and lineal descendants 
are the only partners, or (iv) a tax exempt organization as described in 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.  In such event, the spouse, lineal descendant, 
trustee, partnership or tax exempt organization will be entitled to all of 
the rights of the Grantee with respect to the assigned portion of such Award, 
and such portion of the Award will continue to be subject to all of the 
terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to the Award, as set forth 
herein, and in the related Option Agreement, Restricted Stock Agreement or 
Limited Right Agreement, immediately prior to the effective date of the 
assignment.  Any such assignment will be permitted only if (i) the Grantee 
does not receive any consideration therefor, and (ii) the assignment is 
expressly approved by the Company.  Any such assignment shall be evidenced by 
an appropriate written document executed by the Grantee, and a copy thereof 
shall be delivered to the Company on or prior to the effective date of the

                                       17

<PAGE>

assignment.  This paragraph shall apply to all Awards granted under the Plan 
at any time.

12.  DEATH OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     12.1 Except as hereinafter provided, no Option or Limited Right granted 
pursuant to the Plan may be exercised at any time unless the holder thereof 
is then an employee or director of the Company.  Options and Limited Rights 
granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of employment or 
service on the Board so long as the Grantee continues to be an employee or 
director of the Company.

     12.2 Except as provided in Section 13, the Option or Limited Right of 
any Grantee whose employment or service on the Board is terminated for any 
reason, other than for death, Disability, termination of employment for 
Cause, or Retirement, shall terminate on the earlier of (i) three months 
after termination of employment or service on the Board and (ii) the date 
that such Option or Limited Right expires in accordance with its terms.

     12.3 In the event of the death of a Grantee during employment or service 
on the Board, or within three months after the termination of employment 
(except as described in subsection 12.5) or service on the Board, each Option 
or Limited Right granted to such Grantee shall be exercisable or payable to 
the extent provided therein but not later than one year after his or her 
death (but not beyond the stated duration of the Option or Limited Right).  
Any such exercise or payment shall be made only: (i) by or to the Successor  
of the deceased Grantee; and (ii) to the extent, if any, that the deceased 
Grantee was entitled at the date of his or her death.

     12.4 In the case of the Disability of a Grantee, the Option or Limited 
Right shall terminate on the earlier of (i) one year after termination of 
employment or service on the Board and (ii) the date that such Option or 
Limited Right expires in accordance with its terms.  During such period, the 
Option or Limited Right may be exercised by a Grantee who becomes Disabled 
with respect to the same number of Shares, in the same manner and to the same 
extent if the Grantee had continued employment or service on the Board during 
such period.

                                       18

<PAGE>

     12.5 In the case of a Key Employee, the Option or Limited Right shall 
lapse immediately upon termination of employment of the Grantee  for Cause.

     12.6 In the event of the Grantee's Retirement, the Option or Limited 
Right shall remain exercisable by the retired Grantee until the Award expires 
by its terms and may be exercised by the retired Grantee to the same extent 
as if he or she had continued employment or service on the Board during such 
period; provided, however, if the Grantee dies before the Option or Limited 
Right expires, such Award shall be exercisable only by the Successor of the 
deceased Grantee to the extent that the deceased Grantee was entitled at the 
date of his or her death.

     12.7 Pursuant to subsections 9.5 and 9.6, a Restricted Stock Award shall 
be subject to such restrictions in the event of the death, Disability, 
Retirement or other termination of employment of the Grantee as are set forth 
in the applicable Restricted Stock Agreement.

13.  CHANGE IN CONTROL

     13.1 In the event of a Change in Control, an Award granted to a Key 
Employee shall be affected as follows:

     (a)  In the event of a Change in Control which does not have the prior 
written approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors, and 
notwithstanding any conditions or restrictions contained in an agreement 
related to any Award, any Options (not issued in tandem with a Restricted 
Stock Award) and Limited Rights outstanding to a Grantee shall become 
immediately exercisable and any restrictions on any Restricted Stock (not 
issued in tandem with an Option) shall lapse on the date of such a Change in 
Control.  If an Option is issued in tandem with a Restricted Stock Award, the 
outstanding Option shall become immediately exercisable, or the restrictions 
on the Restricted Stock shall lapse, on the date of such a Change in Control, 
as elected by the Grantee.  Any such election shall be made by the Grantee 
within thirty (30) days after such Change in Control by giving notice to the 
Committee, or the Secretary of any successor corporation or other entity.

                                       19

<PAGE>

     (b)  In the event of a Change in Control which does have the prior 
written approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors, the Committee in 
its sole discretion may, notwithstanding any conditions or restrictions 
contained in an agreement related to any Award, provide that:  (i) all 
Options or Limited Rights, or both, will become immediately exercisable 
and/or all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, or (ii) all Options, 
Limited Rights and Restricted Stock Awards will be exchanged for options, 
limited rights and restricted stock awards of the acquiring or surviving 
corporation of equal or, except in the case of ISOs, greater value.

     13.2 In the event that a Non-Employee Director's membership on the Board 
terminates within one year following a Change in Control which does not have 
the prior written approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors, any 
unexercised NSOs shall become fully exercisable.

     13.3 For the purposes of subsections 13.1 and 13.2, a Change in Control 
shall not have the prior written approval of a majority of the Continuing 
Directors, unless such approval occurs prior to such Change in Control.

     13.4  In the event of a sale of substantially all of the assets of the 
Company, or a merger, consolidation or share exchange involving the Company, 
all obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted 
hereunder shall be binding on the successor to the transaction.  Employment 
of a Key Employee with such a successor shall be considered employment of the 
Key Employee with the Company for purposes of the Plan.

14.  EXERCISE OF AWARDS

     14.1 A person entitled to exercise an Option or Limited Right may do so 
by delivery of a written notice to that effect specifying the number of 
Shares with respect to which the Option or Limited Right is being exercised 
and any other information the Committee may prescribe.  The notice shall be 
accompanied, in the case of an Option, by payment as described in subsection 
14.2.  The notice of exercise of a Limited Right shall be accompanied by the 
Grantee's copy of the writing or writings evidencing the grant

                                       20

<PAGE>

of the Limited Right and the related Option.  Shares issued upon exercise of 
an Option, or in respect of a Restricted Stock Award, shall be issued only in 
the name of the Grantee.  All notices or requests provided for herein shall 
be delivered to the Secretary of the Company.

     14.2 Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in any Option 
Agreement, the Grantee shall pay the purchase price of the Shares upon 
exercise of any Option (i) in cash, (ii) in cash received from a 
broker-dealer to whom the Grantee has submitted an exercise notice consisting 
of a fully endorsed Option (however, in the case of an insider subject to 
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this payment option shall 
only be available to the extent such insider complies with Regulation T 
issued by the Federal Reserve Board), (iii) by delivering Shares having an 
aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Option 
exercise price, (iv) by directing the Company to withhold such number of 
Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of such Option having an aggregate 
Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Option exercise price, 
(v) in the case of a Key Employee, by such other medium of payment as the 
Committee, in its discretion, shall authorize at the time of grant, or (vi) 
by any combination of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).  In the case of an 
election pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, cash shall mean cash or a certified 
or cashier's check issued by a federally insured bank or savings and loan 
association, and made payable to AAR CORP.  In the case of payment pursuant 
to (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Grantee's election must be made on or prior 
to the date of exercise and must be irrevocable.  In lieu of a separate 
election governing each exercise of an Award, a Grantee may file a blanket 
election with the Committee which shall govern all future exercises of Awards 
until revoked by the Grantee. The Company shall issue, in the name of the 
Grantee, stock certificates representing the total number of Shares issuable 
pursuant to the exercise of any Option as soon as reasonably practicable 
after such exercise, provided that any Shares purchased by a Grantee through 
a broker-dealer pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be delivered to such 
broker-dealer in accordance with 12 C.F.R. Section 220.3(e)(4) or other 
applicable provision of law.

                                       21

<PAGE>

15.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE PLAN/AMENDMENT OF AWARDS

     The Plan will become effective on July 16, 1992, contingent upon its 
approval at a meeting of the Company's stockholders by the affirmative votes 
of the holders of a majority of the Company's voting securities present or 
represented and entitled to vote at a meeting duly held within twelve months 
thereafter in accordance with Delaware law and continue thereafter until 
terminated by the Board of Directors.  The terms of any Award may be amended 
at any time prior to the end of their Term in accordance with the Plan.  No 
such amendment may adversely affect the interest of the Grantee of such Award 
without such Grantee's written consent.

16.  DATE OF AWARD

     The date of an Award shall be the date on which the Committee's 
determination to grant the same is final, or such later date as shall be 
specified by the Committee in connection with its determination.

17.  STOCKHOLDER STATUS

     No person shall have any rights as a stockholder by virtue of the grant 
of an Award under the Plan except with respect to Shares actually issued to 
that person.

18.  POSTPONEMENT OF EXERCISE

     The Committee may postpone any exercise of an Option or the distribution 
of any portion of a Restricted Stock Award for such time as the Committee in 
its sole discretion may deem necessary in order to permit the Company (i) to 
effect, amend or maintain any necessary registration of the Plan or the 
Shares issuable upon the exercise of an Option or distributable in 
satisfaction of a Restricted Stock Award under the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, or the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction, (ii) to 
permit any action to be taken in order to (A) list such Shares on a stock 
exchange if Shares are then listed on such exchange or (B) comply with 
restrictions or regulations incident to the maintenance of a public market 
for its Shares, including any rules or regulations of any stock exchange on 
which the Shares

                                       22

<PAGE>

are listed, or (iii) to determine that such Shares and the Plan are exempt 
from such registration or that no action of the kind referred to in (ii)(B) 
above needs to be taken; and the Company shall not be obligated by virtue of 
any terms and conditions of any Award or any provision of the Plan to 
recognize the exercise of an Option or to sell or issue Shares in violation 
of the Securities Act of 1933 or the law of any government having 
jurisdiction thereof.  Any such postponement shall not extend the Term of an 
Option or shorten the Term of any restriction attached to any Restricted 
Stock Award and neither the Company nor its directors or officers shall have 
any obligation or liability to the Grantee of an Award, to the Grantee's 
Successor or to any other person with respect to any Shares as to which the 
Option shall lapse because of such postponement or as to which issuance under 
a Restricted Stock Award was delayed.

19.  TERMINATION, SUSPENSION OR MODIFICATION OF PLAN

     The Board may at any time terminate, suspend or modify the Plan without 
the authorization of stockholders to the extent allowed by law, including 
without limitation any rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     No termination, suspension or modification of the Plan shall adversely 
affect any right acquired by any Grantee or any Successor under an Award 
granted before the date of such termination, suspension or modification, 
unless such Grantee or Successor shall consent; but it shall be conclusively 
presumed that any adjustment for changes in capitalization as provided for 
herein does not adversely affect any such right.  Any member of the Board who 
is an officer or employee of the Company shall be without vote on any 
proposed amendment to the Plan, or on any other matter which might affect 
that member's individual interest under the Plan.

20.  TAXES

     Upon the Taxable Date of any Award, the Company shall have the right to
require the Grantee to remit to the Company an amount in cash sufficient to
satisfy all federal, state and local withholding tax requirements prior to the
delivery by the Company

                                       23

<PAGE>

of cash or any certificate or certificates for Shares. Whenever payments 
under the Plan are to be made in cash, such payments shall be net of any 
amounts sufficient to satisfy all federal, state, local and foreign 
withholding tax requirements.  In connection with an Award in the form of 
Shares and in lieu of making a cash payment to the Company, the Grantee may 
elect to satisfy his or her tax withholding obligation incurred in connection 
with the Taxable Date of an Option or Restricted Stock Award by (i) directing 
the Company to withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise distributable to 
the Grantee, or (ii) by transferring to the Company a certain number of 
Shares (either subject to such Restricted Stock Award or previously owned), 
such Shares being valued at the Fair Market Value for the Shares on such 
Taxable Date.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a 
Grantee's election pursuant to the preceding sentence (i) must be made on or 
prior to the date as of which income is realized by the Grantee in connection 
with such Option or Restricted Stock Award, and (ii) must be irrevocable.  In 
lieu of a separate election on each Taxable Date of an Award, a Grantee may 
file a blanket election with the Committee which shall govern all future 
Taxable Dates until revoked by the Grantee.

     If the holder of Shares purchased in connection with the exercise of an 
Incentive Stock Option disposes of such Shares within two years of the date 
such ISO was granted or within one year of such exercise, he shall notify the 
Company of such disposition and remit an amount necessary to satisfy 
applicable withholding requirements including those arising under federal 
income tax laws. If such holder does not remit such amount, the Company may 
withhold all or a portion of any salary then or in the future owed to such 
holder as necessary to satisfy such requirements.

21.  TENURE

     Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of 
employment between the Company and any person, nor shall the Plan be deemed 
to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or 
limit the right of the Company to employ or discharge any person with or 
without Cause, or to discipline any Employee.

                                       24

<PAGE>

22.  APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS

     The cash proceeds received by the Company from the sale of its Shares 
under the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.

23.  OTHER ACTIONS

     Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the authority of the 
Company to exercise its corporate rights and powers, including, by way of 
illustration and not by way of limitation, the right to grant options for 
proper corporate purposes otherwise than under the Plan to any employee or 
any other person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, or to grant 
options to, or assume options of, any person in connection with the 
acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all 
or any part of the business and assets of any person, firm, corporation, 
association or other entity.

24.  LOAN AGREEMENTS

     Each Award shall be subject to the condition that the Company shall not 
be obligated to issue or transfer its Shares or to pay an amount in cash to 
the Grantee thereof on its exercise, or otherwise, if the Committee or the 
Board determines that such issuance, transfer, or payment, would violate any 
covenant in any loan agreement or other contract to which the Company or a 
Subsidiary is a party.

25.  NOTICES

     Notices given pursuant to the Plan shall be in writing and shall be 
deemed received when personally delivered or three  days after mailed by 
United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, 
addressee only, postage prepaid.  Notice to the Company shall be directed to:

               Corporate Secretary
               AAR CORP.
               1111 Nicholas Boulevard

<PAGE>

Notices to or with respect to a Grantee shall be directed to the Grantee, or 
the Successor of a deceased Grantee, at the Grantee's home address on the 
records of the Company.

26.  AAR CORP. STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

     The AAR CORP. Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, dated August 
1, 1988 ("Non-Employee Directors Plan") is hereby terminated concurrent with 
the effective date hereof, and no further options thereunder shall be granted 
after such termination; provided, however, that such termination shall not 
affect any options outstanding thereunder which shall continue to be subject 
to the terms and conditions of the Non-Employee Directors Plan and the 
written agreements evidencing such options.  The Committee hereunder shall 
have authority to interpret and administer such options and applicable 
agreements. This Amendment and Restatement has been executed by the Company 
by its duly authorized officer effective as of July 16, 1992 and attested by 
its Secretary.
