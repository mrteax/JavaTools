               FURNISHED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY

                                                                April 29, 1998


The Board of Directors of ACCEL International Corporation (the Company), a
Delaware corporation, is soliciting proxies, the form of which is enclosed, for
the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on June 16, 1998. The cost of such
solicitation will be borne by the Company. Officers, directors and regular
employees of the Company may communicate with stockholders personally or by
mail, telephone, telegram or otherwise for the purpose of soliciting such
proxies, but the Company will pay no additional compensation for such
solicitation. The Company and any authorized agent of the Company will request
brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy
soliciting material to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by such
persons and will reimburse the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding
such material. This Proxy Statement is being mailed on or about April 30, 1998.

Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it
is voted by a later appointment received by the Secretary of the Company or by
giving notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Company in writing or
in open meeting. All duly executed proxies received prior to the meeting and not
revoked will be voted at the meeting. The enclosed proxy contains space in which
the stockholder may insert instructions as to the way the stockholder wishes his
shares to be voted. When such proxy is properly executed and returned, the
shares it represents will be voted at the meeting as directed. If no
specification is indicated, the shares will be voted For the election as
directors of the nominees listed below under Election of Directors and For the
Adoption of Amendments to the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan.

April 24, 1998 has been fixed as the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to such notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any
adjournments thereof. On that date the total number of outstanding shares of the
Company entitled to vote at the meeting was 8,557,659 shares of Common Stock,
$.10 par value, (the Common Stock). The holder of each share of such stock is
entitled to one vote. Pursuant to applicable law, broker non-votes and
abstentions will not be counted in favor of or against the election of any
nominee for director or any other proposals to be presented at the meeting. Any
stockholder who abstains from voting on any such other proposal will in effect
be voting against it.

                            1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

In accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, the number of directors has been
fixed at nine by action of the Board of Directors. Directors are elected
annually to serve until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and until their
successors are elected and qualified. The election of directors is decided by a
plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election. In
the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons
named in the proxy to vote the proxies for the election as directors of the
persons nominated below. Although the Board of Directors has no reason to
believe that any of the nominees set forth below will not serve, in the event
that vacancies occur, the proxies will be voted for the election of such
nominees, if any, as shall be designated by the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof.

            SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) requires
the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of the
Common Stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Officers, directors and greater
than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company
with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it or written
representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were required of
them, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997,
all filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than
10% stockholders were complied with, except for one transaction filed late by
Mr. Desich.


                             THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR

                       COMMITTEES, MEETINGS AND FUNCTIONS

The Board of Directors of the Company met five (5) times during 1997. No
director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of directors
and of any committees on which he served. The Board of Directors has established
an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee. It does
not have a Nominating Committee.

The Executive Committee, which exercises the powers of the Board of Directors
between regular meetings of the Board, did not meet during 1997. The membership
of the Executive Committee consists of Messrs. Friedberg, Chase, Deck, Hicks and
Qua. The Audit Committee met one (1) time during 1997 to review the results of
the audit of the Company's 1996 financial statements by the independent
auditors, review the scope of the 1997 audit, consider relevant matters
pertaining to internal controls and accounting procedures, perform other
customary functions of Audit Committees, and to make a recommendation to the
Board of Directors on the engagement of independent auditors for fiscal year
1997. The membership of the Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Qua, Deck and
Hicks.

The Compensation Committee met one (1) time during 1997 for the purpose of
reviewing employee compensation and benefit arrangements. The membership of the
Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Deck, Hicks and Qua. The Report of
the Compensation Committee is contained below.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
- -------------------------

During 1997, non-employee directors of the Company continued to receive the
reduced compensation levels initiated in 1993, and accordingly received an
annual retainer of $5,000 plus a fee of $500 per meeting for attending any
regular or special meetings of the Board of Directors. The members of each
committee of the Board of Directors, other than officers of the Company,
received a fee of $500 for each meeting attended. Chairmen of committees
received a fee of $750 for each meeting attended.

The First Restatement of the ACCEL International Corporation 1987 Stock
Incentive Plan (the Restated Plan) provides for options to be granted every year
to non-employee directors of the Company for a predetermined number of shares of
Common Stock. In 1991, the year the Restated Plan was adopted, the non-employee
directors were granted options for 2,000 shares each. In subsequent years,
options for 1,000 shares each were granted and will continue to automatically be
granted according to the Restated Plan (subject to adjustment for stock
dividends, stock splits and other similar events). Newly appointed or elected
non-employee directors are granted options for 2,000 shares in the year they are
appointed or elected, and thereafter will receive the automatic grants. The
exercise price is equal to the fair market value of a share of stock on the date
the option is granted. Options become exercisable as to 50% of the shares
subject to the option on completion of each full year prior to termination of
the director's status as director after the date the option was granted. The
options lapse on the earliest of the date 10 years after the option was granted,
or the date 180 days after the termination of the director's status as director.
The options shall fully vest and become completely exercisable upon the death or
voluntary retirement of a director. The provisions of the 1996 Stock Incentive
Plan (the 1996 Plan) adopted in 1996, are substantially identical to the
Restated Plan pertaining to non-employee directors.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
- ----------------------

Executive Compensation including the grant of stock options is determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The formal policy previously
established by the Compensation Committee was continued with respect to 1997
compensation as follows:

                      REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Company's compensation package for its executive officers consists of base
salary, participation in a profit sharing plan for senior officers, and periodic
stock option grants or awards. The base salary for Mr. Friedberg, the Chairman
of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, is fixed by the Committee
and may be adjusted as determined periodically by the Committee after a
performance review is conducted. As of June 1, 1996, the Committee had
formulated a compensation arrangement for Mr. Friedberg to include base salary
and authorize a stock option to be granted. A similar compensation arrangement
was approved for Mr. Coats on the recommendation of Mr. Friedberg. Base salary
levels for all other executive officers are determined by Mr. Friedberg and
recommended to the Committee. The amount of profit sharing compensation and
stock option grants or awards, if any, are also determined by this Committee.

Based on Mr. Friedbergs experience and performance, the Committee established a
total aggregate annual compensation level for Mr. Friedberg of $350,000, subject
to an annual review, with an allocation of the $350,000 between cash
compensation and stock options to be determined annually by the Committee. The
stock options granted for this purpose are valued by calculating the difference
between the book value and market value per share as of the date of grant. The
annual review takes into account Company performance, comparative industry data
and various subjective considerations of individual performance as well as
corporate goals. For 1997, cash compensation was set at $275,000, and stock
options were awarded based on the approximate difference between book and market
value.

The Committee believes that a significant or meaningful portion of total cash
compensation should be related to profitability and the achievement of fixed
objectives. Consequently, the profit sharing potential for the Company's
executive officers is conditioned on overall corporate performance
(profitability), and achieving individual and departmental objectives tied to a
percentage of total base salary.



                                       6
<PAGE>   10


Generally speaking, base salary levels are set and adjusted at levels which are
part of the Company's budgetary process, yet are believed by the Committee to be
sufficient to attract and retain qualified executives when considered with the
other components of the Company's compensation structure.

In previous years, profit sharing plans had been adopted for all employees of
the Company and for senior officers. The overall objectives for establishing the
Company's incentive compensation programs were to enhance total compensation
without adding fixed expense, modify the corporate reward systems and give
managers the discretion to reward contributors, better focus management's
attention on the achievement of objectives and drive accountability to all
levels of the Company, and foster teamwork.

For 1997, no profit sharing goal was set for employees and senior officers.
Accordingly, no profit sharing compensation was paid to any employees or senior
officers in 1997.

In addition to approving an ACCEL Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee
determines annual stock option grants or awards to executive officers and other
eligible employees. Stock options are intended to encourage key employees to
remain employed by the Company by providing them with a long-term interest in
the Company's overall performance as reflected by the performance of the market
of the Company's Common Stock.

                2. APPROVAL OF THE ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE
                           1996 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

GENERAL
- -------

On June 11, 1996, the stockholders approved the adoption of the Companys 1996
Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to advance the
long-term interests of the Company by (i) motivating executive officers, other
personnel and independent agents of the Company by means of long-term incentive
compensation; (ii) furthering the identity of interests of participants with
those of the stockholders of the Company, through the ownership and performance
of the Common Stock, $.10 par value, of the Company (Common Stock); and (iii)
permitting the Company to attract and retain directors and executive personnel
upon whose judgment the successful conduct of the business of the Company
largely depends.

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which awards may be
granted under the Plan currently is 1,000,000 of which up to 100,000 shares are
reserved for the grant of stock options to Directors of the Company who are not
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the Outside Directors). The
Plan provides that each person who becomes an Outside Director is initially
entitled to an option to purchase 2,000 shares of Common Stock and an option to
purchase 1,000 at each annual meeting thereafter.

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE PLAN
- -------------------------------

Since 1993 the Outside Directors have received an annual retainer of $5,000
reduced from $7,500 plus a fee of $500 reduced from $750 per meeting for
attending any regular or special meetings of the Board of Directors. Since the
compensation of the Outside Directors has been at a reduced level for five
years, the Board of Directors believed it was appropriate to consider how to
increase such compensation in a manner that was advantageous to both the Outside
Directors and the Company. The Board of Directors concluded that instead of
increasing the cash compensation of the Outside Directors, the Company should be
able to grant options to purchase a greater number of shares than the Plan now
permits. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has approved, subject to the
approval of the stockholders, amendments to the Plan which would increase the
total number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which awards may be
granted from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 of which 500,000 shares rather than 100,000
shares would be reserved for the grant of stock options to Outside Directors. In
addition, each Outside Director would be granted the option to purchase 10,000
instead of 2,000 shares of Common Stock upon his or her initial appointment or
election and at each annual meeting thereafter each Outside Director (other than
any Outside Director who first became a Director at any time during the period
following the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders) would be
granted the option to purchase 10,000 instead of 1,000 shares of Common Stock.
No other changes to the Plan are proposed. The text of the proposed amendments
to the Plan is included in this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A.

Approval of the proposed amendments to the Plan requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares voting in person or by proxy at the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENTS.

                     RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP has served as the independent auditors for the Company for
each of the years in the four-year period ended December 31, 1997. In recent
years, it has been the practice of the Board of Directors to annually review and
select independent auditors for the Company. The Board of Directors intends to
continue such practice and to make the selection of independent auditors later
in the year. The selection of independent auditors has not therefore been made
for the current fiscal year. Representatives of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP will be
present at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders with an opportunity to make a
statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions, if any, of
the stockholders of the Company.

                             STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Stockholders wishing to submit proposals for the Company's 1999 Proxy Statement
may do so prior to December 31, 1998 by letter addressed to the Company in care
of the Secretary.

                                 OTHER MATTERS

Management does not know of any other business to be presented for consideration
at the meeting. If any other business properly comes before the meeting, or any
adjournment or adjournments thereof, the proxy holders will vote in regard
thereto according to their discretion insofar as such proxies are not limited to
the contrary. The 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders is being furnished to
stockholders along with this proxy statement.

On March 16, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the following: that the 1996

     (a) Shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan may be
     authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. Subject to the
     adjustments provided for in Sections 17 and 18 hereof, the maximum number
     of shares of Common Stock available for grant of Awards under the Plan is
     1,500,000 shares. Of this total number, up to 500,000 shares may be issued
     pursuant to the exercise of Directors Stock Options. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to
     be available for grant in any fiscal year exceed ten percent of the total
     number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company. The
     number of shares of Common Stock available for grant to any individual
     Participant in any calendar year shall not exceed 250,000 shares.

SECTION 13. DIRECTORS STOCK OPTIONS
- -----------------------------------

     (a) Grants. Awards may be granted to non-employee Directors only in the
     form of stock options satisfying the requirements of this Section 13. Each
     person who is elected or appointed to serve as a Director of the Company
     after the effective date of the First Amendment to the Plan shall, upon his
     initial appointment or election as a Director, automatically be granted an
     option for 10,000 shares of Common Stock. At each years annual meeting of
     the stockholders of the Company commencing on the effective date of the
     First Amendment to the Plan, there shall be granted automatically to each
     non-employee Director (other than any non-employee Director who first
     became a Director at any time during the period following the immediately
     preceding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company), the option to
     purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock. All stock options granted under
     this Section 13 shall be nonqualified stock options.
