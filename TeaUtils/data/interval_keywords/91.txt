                               GENERAL INFORMATION

INFORMATION ABOUT PROXY SOLICITATION

This proxy statement is being furnished to holders of shares as of the record
date of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Aceto Corporation (the
"Company"), a New York corporation, in connection with the Company's annual
meeting to be held on Thursday, December 2, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard
Time, at the Company's offices. We sent you this proxy statement because our
board of directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the annual
meeting and at any adjournment. This proxy statement summarizes information that
we are required to provide to you under the rules of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., which
information is designed to assist you in voting your shares. The purposes of the
meeting and the matters to be acted on are stated in the accompanying notice of
annual meeting of shareholders. At present, the board of directors knows of no
other business that will come before the meeting.

We will begin mailing these proxy materials on or about October 22, 2004. The
Company will bear the cost of its solicitation of proxies. The original
solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by personal interview,
telephone, and facsimile by the directors, officers and employees of the
Company. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage houses and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material
to the beneficial owners of stock held by such persons, and the Company may
reimburse those custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in doing so.

INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING

Q:      WHY AM I RECEIVING THESE MATERIALS?

A:      The board of directors is providing these proxy materials to you in
        connection with the Company's annual meeting of shareholders, which will
        take place on December 2, 2004. As a shareholder, you are invited to
        attend the annual meeting and to vote on the items of business described
        in this proxy statement.

Q:      WHAT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN THESE MATERIALS?

A:      The information included in this proxy statement relates to the
        proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting, the voting process, the
        compensation of directors and the most highly paid executive officers,
        and certain other required information. A copy of our annual report is
        also enclosed.

Q:      WHAT ITEMS OF BUSINESS WILL BE VOTED ON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING?

A:      The two items of business scheduled to be voted on at the annual meeting
        are: (1) election of directors; and (2) ratification of the independent
        auditors. We will also consider any other business that properly comes
        before the annual meeting.

Q:      HOW DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE?

Q:      WHAT SHARES CAN I VOTE?

A:      You may vote all shares owned by you as of the close of business on
        October 7, 2004, the record date. These shares include: (1) shares held
        directly in your name as a shareholder of record; and (2) shares held
        for you, as the beneficial owner, through a broker or other nominee,
        such as a bank.

Q:      WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD
        AND AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER?

A:      Most shareholders of the Company hold their shares through a broker or
        other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized
        below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and
        those owned beneficially.

        If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's
        transfer agent, The Bank of New York, you are considered, with respect
        to those shares, the shareholder of record and these proxy materials are
        being sent directly to you by the Company. As the shareholder of record,
        you have the right to grant your proxy directly to the board of
        directors or to vote in person at the meeting. The board of directors
        has enclosed or sent a proxy card for you to use.

        If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee,
        you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name,"
        and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or
        nominee together with a voting instruction card. As the beneficial
        owner, you have the right to direct your broker or nominee how to vote
        and are also invited to attend the annual meeting. However, since you
        are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in
        person at the meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker
        or nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the
        shares. Your broker or nominee has enclosed or provided voting
        instructions for you to use in directing the broker or nominee how to
        vote your shares.

Q:      HOW CAN I ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING?

A:      You are entitled to attend the annual meeting only if you were a
        shareholder of the Company or joint holder as of the close of business
        on October 7, 2004, or you hold a valid proxy for the annual meeting.
        You should be prepared to present photo identification for admittance.
        If you are not a record holder but hold shares through a broker or
        nominee (that is, in "street name"), you should provide proof of
        beneficial ownership on the record date, such as your most recent
        account statement prior to October 7, 2004, a copy of the voting
        instruction card provided by your broker or nominee, or other similar
        evidence of ownership. If you do not provide photo identification or
        comply with the other procedures outlined above upon request, you will
        not be admitted to the annual meeting. The annual meeting will begin
        promptly at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Check-in will begin at
        9:00 a.m., and you should allow ample time for the check-in procedures.

Q:      HOW CAN I VOTE MY SHARES IN PERSON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING?

A:      You may vote in person at the annual meeting any shares that you hold as
        the shareholder of record. You may only vote in person shares held in
        street name if you obtain from the broker or nominee that holds your
        shares a "legal proxy" giving you the right to vote the shares.

Q:      HOW CAN I VOTE MY SHARES WITHOUT ATTENDING THE ANNUAL MEETING?

A:      Whether you hold shares directly as the shareholder of record or
        beneficially in street name, you may without attending the meeting
        direct how your shares are to be voted. If you are a shareholder of
        record, you may vote by granting a proxy. If you hold shares in street
        name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker or
        nominee. Each record holder of Company common stock may submit a proxy
        by completing, signing, and dating a proxy card and mailing it in the
        accompanying pre-addressed envelope. Each shareholder who holds shares
        in street name may vote by mail by completing, signing, and dating a
        voting instruction card provided by the broker or nominee and mailing it
        in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope.

<PAGE>

Q:      CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE?

A:      You may change your vote at any time prior to the vote at the annual
        meeting. For shares held directly in your name, you may accomplish this
        by granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically
        revokes the earlier proxy) or by attending the annual meeting and voting
        in person. Attendance at the meeting will not cause your previously
        granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request. For
        shares you hold beneficially, you may change your vote by submitting new
        voting instructions to your broker or nominee or, if you have obtained a
        "legal proxy" from your broker, or nominee giving you the right to vote
        your shares, by attending the meeting and voting in person. You may also
        change your vote by sending a written notice of revocation to Mr.
        Douglas Roth, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary, Aceto
        Corporation, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New York 11042.

Q:      WHO CAN HELP ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

A:      If you have any questions about the annual meeting or how to vote or
        revoke your proxy, you should contact Mr. Terry Steinberg, Vice
        President, Administration and Assistant Corporate Secretary, by mail to
        Aceto Corporation, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New York 11042 or by
        phone at 516-627-6000. Also, if you need additional copies of this proxy
        statement or voting materials, you should contact Mr. Steinberg.

Q:      HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED?

A:      In the election of directors, you may vote FOR all of the seven nominees
        or you may direct your vote to be WITHHELD with respect to one or more
        of the seven nominees. With respect to ratification of the independent
        auditors, you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. If you ABSTAIN, it has
        the same effect as a vote AGAINST. If you provide specific instructions,
        your shares will be voted as you instruct. If you sign your proxy card
        or voting instruction card with no further instructions, your shares
        will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the board of
        directors (FOR all of the Company's nominees and FOR ratification of the
        independent auditors and, in the discretion of the proxy holders, on any
        other matters that properly come before the meeting). If any other
        matters properly arise at the meeting, your proxy, together with the
        other proxies received, will be voted at the discretion of the proxy
        holders.

Q:      WHAT IS A QUORUM AND WHY IS IT NECESSARY?

A:      Conducting business at the meeting requires a quorum. The presence,
        either in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the
        Company's shares of common stock outstanding on October 7, 2004 is
        necessary to constitute a quorum. Under the New York Business
        Corporation Law, and the Company's articles of incorporation and
        by-laws, abstentions are treated as present for purposes of determining
        whether a quorum exists.

Q:      WHAT IS THE VOTING REQUIREMENT TO APPROVE EACH OF THE PROPOSALS?

A:      In the election of directors, the seven persons receiving the highest
        number of FOR votes at the annual meeting will be elected. Accordingly,
        abstentions and broker non-votes do not have the effect of a vote for or
        against the election of any nominee. You do not have the right to
        cumulate your votes. All other proposals require the affirmative "FOR"
        vote of a majority of those shares present in person or represented by
        proxy and entitled to vote on that proposal at the annual meeting.
        Accordingly, abstentions on other proposals will have the same effect as
        a vote against the proposal. In addition, where brokers are prohibited
        from exercising discretionary authority for beneficial owners who have
        not provided voting instructions (commonly referred to as "broker
        non-votes"), those shares will not be included in the vote totals.
        Broker non-votes will not have the effect of a vote for or against other
        proposals. A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting
        will be available at the annual meeting for examination by any
        shareholder.

Q:      WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE SET OF VOTING MATERIALS?

A:      You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including
        multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or
        voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more
        than one


                                        6
<PAGE>

        brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card
        for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a
        shareholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one
        name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete, sign,
        date, and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you
        receive.

Q:      WHERE CAN I FIND THE VOTING RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING?

A:      We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting
        and publish final results in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
        fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004.

Q:      WHAT HAPPENS IF ADDITIONAL MATTERS ARE PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING?

A:      Other than the two items of business described in this proxy statement,
        we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the annual
        meeting. However, if you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy
        holders, Leonard S. Schwartz, the Company's Chairman, President and
        Chief Executive Officer, and Douglas Roth, the Company's Chief Financial
        Officer and Secretary, will have the discretion to vote your shares on
        any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting. If
        for any unforeseen reason any of our nominees is not available as a
        candidate for director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote
        your proxy for any one or more other candidates nominated by the board
        of directors.

Q:      WHAT SHARES ARE ENTITLED TO BE VOTED?

A:      Each share of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding as of
        the close of business on October 7, 2004, the record date, is entitled
        to be voted on all items being voted at the annual meeting, with each
        share being entitled to one vote. On the record date, 16,065,480 shares
        of the Company's common stock were issued and outstanding.

Q:      WHO WILL COUNT THE VOTES?

A:      One or more inspectors of election will tabulate the votes.

Q:      IS MY VOTE CONFIDENTIAL?

A:      Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify
        individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your
        voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed, either within the
        Company or to anyone else, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable
        legal requirements; (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and
        certification of the vote; or (3) to facilitate a successful proxy
        solicitation.

Q:      WHO WILL BEAR THE COST OF SOLICITING VOTES FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING?

A:      The board of directors is making this solicitation and will pay the
        entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing
        these proxy materials. Certain of our directors, officers and employees,
        without any additional compensation, may also solicit your vote in
        person, by telephone or by electronic communication. On request, we will
        also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and
        fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding
        proxy and solicitation materials to shareholders.

Q:      MAY I PROPOSE ACTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION AT NEXT YEAR'S ANNUAL MEETING OF
        SHAREHOLDERS?

A:      You may submit proposals for consideration at future shareholder
        meetings. However, in order for a shareholder proposal to be considered
        for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for the annual meeting
        next year, the written proposal must be received by the corporate
        secretary of the Company no later than June 18, 2005. Such proposals
        also will need to comply with United States Securities and Exchange
        Commission regulations under Proxy Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of
        shareholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials.

(1)     This director is a member of the executive compensation committee.
(2)     This director is a member of the audit committee.
(3)     This director is designated the lead independent director.

It is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy card to vote
all shares of common stock for which they have been granted a proxy for the
election of the nominees, each to serve as a director until the next annual
meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified. All the nominees have consented to being named in this
proxy statement and to serve as a director if elected.

At the time of the annual meeting, if any of the nominees named above is not
available to serve as director (an event that the board of directors does not
currently have any reason to anticipate), all proxies will be voted for any one

directors believes that it is in the best interests of the Company to elect the
above-described slate of directors.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S COMMITTEES

AUDIT COMMITTEE

The audit committee is comprised of Ira S. Kallem (Chairman), Albert L. Eilender
and Hans C. Noetzli. The audit committee is responsible for recommending the
Company's independent auditor and reviewing management actions in matters
relating to audit functions. The committee reviews with the Company's
independent auditors the scope and results of its audit engagement and the
Company's system of internal controls and procedures. The committee also reviews
the effectiveness of procedures intended to prevent violations of laws. The
Committee also reviews, prior to publication, our quarterly earnings releases
and reports to the SEC on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. The report of the audit
committee for fiscal year 2004 can be found below under the heading "Proposal
Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditors."

The audit committee, consistent with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
rules adopted thereunder, also meets with management and the auditors prior to
the filing of officers' certifications with the SEC to request information
concerning, among other things, significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls, if any.


                                        9
<PAGE>

Our board has determined that all audit committee members are independent under
applicable SEC regulations, and as defined by Rule 4200 (a)(14) of the Nasdaq
Marketplace Rules. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Kallem
qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is used in
Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The audit committee operates
under a formal charter that governs its duties and conduct. The charter was
attached as an appendix to the Company's 2003 proxy statement, and is published
on the Company's corporate website - WWW.ACETO.COM.

The audit committee has adopted a Non-Retaliation Policy and a Complaint
Monitoring Procedure to enable confidential and anonymous reporting regarding
financial irregularities, if any.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The executive compensation committee is comprised of Leonard S. Schwartz
(Chairman), Samuel I. Hendler, Robert A. Wiesen, Stanley H. Fischer and Albert
L. Eilender. The executive compensation committee is responsible for
recommending the remuneration of the Company's executive officers, including
recommendations with respect to the Company's stock option plans. The executive
compensation committee operates under formal charter that governs its duties and
conduct. The charter is published on the Company's corporate website.

BOARD NOMINATIONS

The Company's board of directors does not have a nominating committee. Instead,
nominations for director are made by the full board of directors. The board
believes this process is preferable because it wishes to involve all of its
directors in the nomination process.

The Company's board has determined that candidates for director should have
certain minimum qualifications, including being able to understand basic
financial statements, being over 21 years of age, having relevant business
experience, and having high moral character. The board of directors retains the
right to modify these minimum qualifications from time to time.

In evaluating an incumbent director whose term of office is set to expire, the
board of directors reviews that director's overall service to the Company during
that director's term, including the number of meetings attended, level of
participation, quality of performance, and any transactions with the Company
engaged in by that director during his or her term.

When selecting a new director nominee, the committee first determines whether
the nominee must be independent for Nasdaq purposes or whether the candidate
must qualify as an "Audit Committee Financial Expert," as that term is used in
section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The board then uses its network
of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if
it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. Each director then has an
opportunity to privately interview each nominee if he or she deems it necessary.
The board then meets to consider the candidates' qualifications and chooses
candidates by a unanimous vote.

Shareholders wishing to directly recommend candidates for election to the board
of directors at an annual meeting must do so by giving notice in writing to
Leonard S. Schwartz, Chairman, Aceto Corporation, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success,
New York 11042. Any such notice must, for any given annual meeting, be delivered
to the Chairman not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the preceding
year's annual meeting. The notice must state (1) the name and address of the
shareholder making the recommendations, (2) the name, age, business address, and
residential address of each person recommended, (3) the principal occupation or
employment of each person recommended, (4) the class and number of shares of
Aceto shares that are beneficially owned by each person recommended and by the
recommending shareholder, (5) any other information concerning the persons
recommended that must be disclosed in nominee and proxy solicitations in
accordance with Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (6) a
signed consent of each person recommended stating that he or she consents to
serve as a director of the Company if elected.


                                       10
<PAGE>

The board of directors will consider and vote on any recommendations so
submitted. In considering any person recommended by a shareholder, the committee
will look for the same qualifications that it looks for in any other person that
it is considering for a position on the board of directors.

Any shareholder nominee proposed by the board of directors for election at the
next annual meeting of shareholders will be included in the company's proxy
statement for that annual meeting.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS

During the Company's fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, the board of directors
held five meetings and acted by unanimous written consent three times. Each
director attended more than 75% of the board meetings and meetings of the board
committees on which he served.

During the Company's fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, the executive compensation
committee met four times, and the audit committee met nine times.

At each scheduled meeting of the board of diectors, the independent members of
the board of directors meet separately in executive session without management
being present. A lead director elected by the independent directors is
responsible for chairing such executive sessions. Currently the lead director is
Albert L. Eilender.

DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETINGS

Our directors are encouraged, but not required, to attend the annual meeting of
shareholders. All of our directors attended the 2003 annual meeting of
shareholders.

COMMUNICATIONS BY OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Our board of directors recommends that shareholders direct to the Company's
corporate secretary any communications intended for the board of directors.
Shareholders can send communications by e-mail to droth@aceto.com, by facsimile
to (516) 627-6093, or by mail to Douglas Roth, Chief Financial Officer and
Secretary, Aceto Corporation, One Hollow Lane, Lake Success, New York 11042.

This centralized process will assist the board in reviewing and responding to
shareholder communications in an appropriate manner. If a shareholder wishes to
direct any communication to a specific board member, the name of that board
member should be noted in the communication. The board of directors has
instructed the corporate secretary to forward shareholder correspondence only to
the intended recipients, but the board has also instructed the corporate
secretary to review all shareholder correspondence and, in his discretion, not
forward any items that he deems to be of a commercial or frivolous nature or
otherwise inappropriate for the board's consideration. Any such items may be
forwarded elsewhere in the Company for review and possible response.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Company operates within a comprehensive plan of corporate governance for the
purpose of defining responsibilities, setting high standards of professional and
personal conduct and assuring compliance with those responsibilities and
standards. In July 2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which,
among other things, establishes, or provides the basis for, a number of new
corporate governance standards and disclosure requirements. In addition, the
Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. has recently made changes to its corporate governance
and listing requirements. The board of directors has initiated numerous actions
consistent with these new rules and will continue to regularly monitor
developments in the area of corporate governance.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Worldwide Financial Management that
sets forth standards of ethics for the Company's principal executive officer and
senior financial officers, violations of which are reported to the audit
committee. This Code of Ethics was attached as an appendix to the Company's 2003
proxy statement, and is published on the Company's corporate website.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT FOR ALL ACETO EMPLOYEES

The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct for all Aceto Employees that
includes provisions ranging from restrictions on gifts to conflicts of interest.
All employees are required to affirm in writing their acceptance of the code.
The Code of Business Conduct was attached as an appendix to the Company's 2003
proxy statement, and is published on the Company's corporate website.

NASDAQ CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS

The Company also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all Aceto
directors and employees in accordance with Nasdaq Qualitative Listing
Requirement 4350(n). This Code of Conduct is published on the Company's
corporate website.

DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE

The Company has formed a disclosure committee, comprised of senior management,
including senior financial personnel, to formalize processes to ensure accurate
and timely disclosure in Aceto's periodic reports filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission and to implement certain disclosure controls
and procedures. The disclosure committee operates under a formal charter that
governs its duties and conduct. The charter was attached as an appendix to the
Company's 2003 proxy statement, and is published on the Company's corporate
website.

PERSONAL LOANS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

The Company's policy has always been to not extend personal loans or other terms
of personal credit to its directors and officers, and it will comply with the
recently enacted legislation prohibiting such personal loans and other forms of
personal credit.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Company's directors and
executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Company's
Common Stock are required to file certain reports, within specified time
periods, indicating their holdings of and transactions in the Common Stock and
derivative securities. Based solely on a review of such reports provided to the
Company and written representations from such persons regarding the necessity to
file such reports, the Company is not aware of any failures to file reports or
report transactions in a timely manner during the Company's fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

Directors of the Company who are not also employees currently receive $30,000
per year for serving on the board of directors plus fees ranging from $1,000 to
$2,500 for each committee or special board meeting attended. In addition, the
lead independent director receives $5,000 per year for serving in such capacity.
Directors of the Company who are also employees are not compensated for their
services as Directors.

On August 5, 2003, the Company granted each of Messrs. Eilender, Hendler,
Wiesen, Fischer, Noetzli and Kallem 6,750 non-qualified stock options, adjusted
to reflect the effect of the 3-for-2 stock dividend paid January 2, 2004,
pursuant to the 2002 Stock Option Plan. Each option vests on December 15, 2004,
is exercisable at $12.33 (adjusted) and expires 10 years from the date of grant.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

The Company has no employment agreements with its senior executives.

LIMITS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

The Company's Articles of Incorporation eliminate the personal liability of its
directors to the Company and its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of
the directors' fiduciary duties in certain circumstances. The articles of
incorporation further provide that the Company will indemnify its officers and
directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Company believes that such
indemnification covers at least negligence and gross negligence on the part of
the indemnified parties. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the
Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons
of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Company
has been advised that in the opinion of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

Members of the executive compensation committee, with the exception of Leonard
S. Schwartz, have never served as officers or employees of the Company or any of
our subsidiaries. During the last fiscal year, none of our senior executives
served on the board of directors or committee of any other entity whose officers
served either on our board of directors or executive compensation committee.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The executive compensation committee of the board of directors, is comprised of
Leonard S. Schwartz (Chairman), Stanley H. Fischer, Samuel I. Hendler, Albert L.
Eilender and Robert A. Wiesen, and makes recommendations to the Board with
respect to the remuneration of the Company's executive officers.

The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the Company to
attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and abilities will
contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum profitability to
the Company and its shareholders, by providing salaries and benefits competitive
with those offered by other companies in the chemical industry. The executive
compensation program includes base salary, annual incentive compensation (cash
bonuses), and long term incentive compensation (awards under the Company's stock
option plans).

Base salaries are set at levels competitive within the chemical industry.
Because of the way the Company operates its business, the contributions of its
executives significantly affect corporate profitability. Bonuses (which can
exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such contributions. The
Company's Chief Executive Officer also is the Chairman of the Board, and
President of the Company. The bonuses paid to the Chief Executive Officer and to
the Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer, are intended to
reflect the Company's overall performance.

The three highest paid executives, other than the Chief Executive Officer, are
each responsible for the performance of one of the Company's principal profit
centers. Internally generated performance records are kept on a monthly and
yearly basis for these profit centers, and each center's profitability is
compared in the current year to the previous year.

Other factors considered in determining the bonuses of individual executives are
the individual's own performance and the overall performance of the Company. The
compensation committee determines each bonus primarily based on this data, also
taking into account the long term contributions of each individual.

The Chief Executive Officer's compensation was determined on the basis of the
same factors utilized to compensate other executives, taking into consideration
total compensation comparisons of top executives of corporations in the chemical
industry. The Chief Executive Officer is not present at the time that his
compensation is evaluated and determined.

The executive compensation committee operates under a formal charter that
governs its duties and conduct. The charter is published on the Company's
website.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

The audit committee is comprised of Ira S. Kallem (Chairman), Albert L. Eilender
and Hans C. Noetzli. Each of these directors meets the independence and
expertise requirements of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. The audit
committee recommends the engagement of the Company's independent auditor and
reviews and considers actions of management in matters relating to audit
functions. The audit committee also reviews with the independent auditor the
scope and results of its audit engagement, the Company's system of internal
controls and procedures, and reviews the effectiveness of procedures intended to
prevent violations of laws. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the audit
committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial
statements for the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 with the
Company's management and KPMG LLP, the Company's independent auditors.

Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in September 2003 the audit
committee established the Aceto Corporation Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy
whereby the Committee is required to pre-approve the audit fees, and the
provision of certain tax and other non-audit related services by KPMG LLP after
KPMG LLP provides a detailed description of the services to be performed and
specific fee estimates for each such service. The audit committee limits the
engagement by the Company of KPMG LLP for non-audit services and tax services to
those circumstances where the services are considered integral to the audit
services that it provides, or in which there is another compelling rationale for
using its services. The audit committee considered the provision by KPMG LLP of
the below mentioned tax services and other non-audit services and concluded that
the provision of these services was compatible with maintaining the independence
of KPMG LLP.

The audit committee has discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be
discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, "Communication with audit
committees." In addition, the audit committee has received the written
disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by Independence Standards
Board Standard No. 1, "Independence Discussions with audit committees" and has
discussed with KPMG LLP its independence from the Company and its management.

Finally, in reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit
committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited consolidated
financial statements for the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 be
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2004
which has been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Respectfully submitted October 7, 2004 by the members of the audit committee.
