                                   PROXY STATEMENT

          The following information is furnished in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company for the
annual meeting of shareholders to be held on Wednesday, August 23, 1995, at
4:00 P.M., Atlanta time, in the Board Room of the Company, at the above
address. A copy of the Company's annual report for the fiscal year ended
April 30, 1995, and a proxy for use at the meeting are enclosed with this
proxy statement. This proxy statement and the enclosed proxy were first
mailed to shareholders on or about July 21, 1995.

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

          Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked,
without compliance with any other for- malities, by any shareholder who
attends the meeting and gives oral notice of his or her election to vote in
person. In addition, any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be
revoked prior to the meeting by delivering to the Secretary of the Company a
notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy for the same shares bearing a
later date. All proxies of shareholders solicited by the Company which are
properly executed and received by the Secretary of the Company prior to the
meeting, and which are not revoked, will be voted at the meeting. The shares
represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions
thereon, and unless specifically instructed to vote otherwise, the
individuals named in the enclosed proxy will vote to elect all the nominees
as set forth in this proxy statement. Abstentions and broker non-votes will
be included in determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting,
but will otherwise have no effect on the election of the nominees for
Director. A system administered by the Company's transfer agent will tabulate
the votes cast.

          The cost of soliciting proxies is paid by the Company. Copies of
solicitation material may be furnished to banks, brokerage houses and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding to beneficial owners
of shares of the Company's common stock, $1.00 par value per share
(the "Common Stock"), and normal handling charges may be paid for such
forwarding service. In addition to soliciting by mail, Directors and
regular employees of the Company, at no additional compensation, may
assist in soliciting proxies by telephone or telegraph.

          As of July 17, 1995, the record date for the annual meeting, there
were 2,992,940 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. The
holders of Common Stock, the only class of voting stock of the Company
outstanding, are entitled to one vote per share.

                        NOMINATION AND ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

          The Board of Directors recommends the election of the ten (10)
nominees listed below to constitute the entire Board to hold office until the
next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are

                                  1

<PAGE>

elected and qualified. If, at the time of the annual meeting, any
of such nominees should be unable to serve, the persons named in the proxy
will vote for such substitutes or vote to reduce the number of Directors for
the ensuing year as management recommends. Management has no reason to
believe that any substitute nominee or nominees or reduction in the number of
Directors for the ensuing year will be required. The affirmative vote of a
plurality of the votes cast is required to elect the nominees.

          All of the nominees are now Directors of the Company and have
served continuously since their first election. The following information
relating to: (1) age as of August 23, 1995; (2) directorships in other
publicly-held companies; (3) positions with the Company; (4) principal
employment; and (5) Common Stock owned beneficially as of June 30, 1995, has
been furnished by the respective nominees. Except as otherwise indicated,
each nominee has been or was engaged in his present or last principal
employment, in the same or a similar position, for more than five years.

          Bernard W. Abrams announced to the Board of Directors on May 24,
1995, that he will recommend changes in the leadership of the Company to be
effective August 23, 1995, the date of the Annual Meeting. Edward M. Abrams
will be recommended to become Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and
Joseph H. Rubin will be recommended to become President and Chief Operating
Officer. Bernard W. Abrams would remain with the Company as Chairman of the
Executive Committee. Such recommendations will be considered by the Board at
its August 23, 1995, meeting to be held immediately prior to the Annual
Meeting of Shareholders.

</TABLE>
                          BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

          The objectives of the Company's compensation program are to enhance
the profitability of the Company, and thus shareholder value, by aligning
compensation with business goals and performance and attracting, retaining
and rewarding Executive Officers who contribute to the long-term success of
the Company. In furtherance of these goals, the Company's compensation
program for Executive Officers includes base salary, annual bonus and, in
some cases, stock option incentives.

          SALARY. The Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of
Directors of a subsidiary company, as the case may be, determines the base
salary for the Executive Officers, including the CEO, based upon the
financial performance (including profitability and/or revenues) of the
Company or subsidiary, as the case may be, and by the individual's level of
responsibility, time with the Company, contribution and performance.
Evaluation of these factors is subjective, and no fixed, relative weights are
assigned to the criteria considered. The beginning point for determining the
salary is the base salary the Executive Officer 

                                  6
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

received in the prior fiscal year. The CEO's salary increase for
fiscal 1995 was based primarily upon the Company's financial performance in
fiscal 1994, including, among other factors, the growth in per share
earnings.

          BONUS. The majority of the Bonuses and All Other Compensation
reported in the Annual Compensation Table above was paid pursuant to the
Company's profit-sharing plan. In general, all employees meeting certain
service requirements are eligible to participate in this plan. The aggregate
contribution of the Company is set annually by the Board of Directors and
then allocated based on the eligible compensation of participants. As a
result, profit-sharing plan allocations are based on the same factors as are
the salaries of the Executive Officers.

          The Board of Directors of the Company or the Board of Directors of
a subsidiary company, as the case may be, also determines the amount of an
annual cash bonus, separate from the profit-sharing plan, for certain of the
Executive Officers. These bonuses are based upon the financial performance
(including profitability and/or revenues) of the Company or subsidiary, as
the case may be, and by the individual's level of responsibility, time with
the Company, contribution and performance. The CEO receives no such annual
cash bonus.

          STOCK OPTIONS. The Company also maintains a stock option plan to
provide additional incentives to certain employees to maximize shareholder
values. Options granted pursuant to this plan utilize vesting periods to
encourage key employees to continue in the employ of the Company. The Company
has granted options from time to time to a limited number of employees,
including grants prior to fiscal 1995 to two of the executive officers other
than the CEO.

          The Company does not anticipate that the law that serves to cap
executive compensation that is deductible by the Company at $1,000,000 will
have any impact on the compensation policies of the Company.

          The tables included in the proxy statement and accompanying
narrative and footnotes, reflect the decisions covered by the above
discussion. The foregoing report has been furnished by the members of the
Board of Directors:

       Bernard W. Abrams                                  Richard H. Danielson
       Edward M. Abrams                                   Donald W. MacLeod
       Alan R. Abrams                                     L. Anthony Montag
       J. Andrew Abrams                                   Joseph H. Rubin
       Paula Lawton Bevington                             Felker W. Ward, Jr.

                                DIRECTORS COMPENSATION

          Each Director is paid a retainer of $550 per month and a fee of
$1,200 per Board of Directors meeting attended. In addition, Directors who
are members of the Audit Committee, but who are not Officers of the Company,
are paid a fee of $600 for each Audit Committee meeting attended.

          DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. The Company maintains a
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan")
under which members of the Board of Directors of the Company may elect to
defer to a future date receipt all or any part of their compensation as
Directors and/or as members of a committee of the Board. For purposes of the
Deferred Compensation Plan, "compensation" means the retainer fees and
meeting fees payable to such Directors by the Company in their capacities as
Directors or as members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

                                  7
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

          The Deferred Compensation Plan is administered by the Executive
Committee of the Board of Directors. A committee member may not participate
in any decision relating in any way to his individual rights or obligations
as a participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

          A Director must make an election in writing to be a participant
under the Deferred Compensation Plan prior to the first day of the month for
which the election is to be effective. An election is effective thereafter
until revoked by such Director in writing. Compensation deferred under the
Deferred Compensation Plan is credited, for record keeping purposes, to the
account for each participating Director and bears interest until paid at an
annual rate calculated quarterly equal to the average of the 13-week Treasury
Bill rate established at weekly auctions during such quarter. The Company
will make payments of deferred compensation and interest earned on such
deferred compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan at the time
specified by each participant in a lump sum or, at the sole discretion of the
participant, in no more than five equal annual installments. For the year
ended April 30, 1995, five members of the Board of Directors (including three
Executive Officers who are also Directors) participated in the Deferred
Compensation Plan. The Company's obligations under this Plan are not funded.
