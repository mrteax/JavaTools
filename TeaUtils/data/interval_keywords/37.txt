                                PROXY STATEMENT
 
     The accompanying proxies are solicited by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on June 16,
1997 and any adjournments thereof.
 
     Shareholders of record at the close of business on April 25, 1997 (the
record date) will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. At that date the
Corporation had issued and outstanding 3,469,338 Common Shares without par
value. Each such Share is entitled to one vote on all matters properly coming
before the Annual Meeting. At least 1,734,670 Common Shares must be represented
at the meeting in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business.
 
     This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy were first mailed
to Shareholders on May 14, 1997.
 
                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
     The Corporation's Board of Directors currently consists of nine (9)
persons, divided into three classes (Classes I, II and III) consisting of three
Directors each. At this Annual Meeting, Class III Directors are to be elected
for a term expiring at the 2000 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board of Directors has
designated the three (3) persons first named in the table below as nominees for
Director for such term. Each of the nominees presently is a Director.
 
     Unless a Shareholder requests that voting of his or her proxy be withheld
for the nominees for election as Class III Directors in accordance with the
instructions set forth on such proxy, it presently is intended that Common
Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby will be voted for the election as
Class III Directors of the nominees designated by the Board of Directors. All
nominees have consented to being
<PAGE>   4
 
named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. Should any nominee
subsequently decline or be unable to accept such nomination or to serve as a
Director, an event which the Board of Directors does not now expect, the persons
voting the Common Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby may either vote
such shares for a substitute nominee for such class or for a reduced number of
nominees, as they may deem advisable. For election as a Director, a nominee must
receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the Common Shares entitled to vote
which are present or represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy.
Neither abstentions nor broker non-votes will be counted as votes cast, although
both will count toward the determination of the presence of a quorum and both
will have the same effect as a vote against the nominee.
 
     In the event Shareholders shall have the right to cumulate their voting
power for the election of Directors (see GENERAL INFORMATION -- CUMULATIVE
VOTING for the procedure required to initiate cumulative voting), the persons
designated as proxies will allocate the votes among the nominees designated for
election in accordance with their judgment. Cumulative voting permits a holder
of Common Shares to give one nominee a number of votes equal to the number of
Directors to be elected by the Shareholders multiplied by the number of Common
Shares the Shareholder may vote, or a Shareholder may distribute votes on the
same principle among two or three nominees.
 
     The information concerning the nominees set forth in the following table is
based in part on information received from the respective nominees and in part
on the Corporation's records:

     The Corporation's compensation program is administered by the Compensation
Committee, which consists exclusively of non-employee Directors. This
compensation program is designed and administered to align the interests of the
Corporation's executive officers and its other key employees with that of the
Corporation's Shareholders, to link compensation to the performance of the
Corporation as well as to individual contributions and to provide compensation
at a level which is competitive in the marketplace so that the Corporation can
continue to attract, motivate, and retain qualified management.
 
     The Corporation's compensation program for its executive officers
(including the named executive officers) and certain other key employees
consists of an annual salary, bonus (in some instances) and a long-term
incentive represented by stock options and, in some instances, deferred
compensation. The policies in respect of each of these elements, as well as the
basis for determining the compensation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, Mr. Robert S. Reitman (the "CEO"), are described below.
 
     The Compensation Committee establishes annual salaries to be competitive
with the marketplace and to reflect the varying levels of responsibilities of
the CEO and the other executive officers. Such salaries are based, in part, on
information provided to the Corporation by independent compensation consultants.
 
                                        5
<PAGE>   8
 
     The services of independent compensation consultants also are used by the
Corporation in respect of surveying compensation levels and trends in industry
generally and in respect of structuring the bonus component of the compensation
of the CEO and the other executive officers. For the Corporation's executive
officers, annual bonuses are based upon an evaluation of their respective
division's actual performance against its business plan. Assuming that
performance levels are achieved, the bonus paid is a predetermined percentage of
the division's pretax profits. In the event that predetermined standards are not
achieved, bonuses are subject to reduction. In addition to earnings performance,
the Compensation Committee evaluates other managerial achievements of the
Corporation's executive officers as a component of bonus awards.
 
     The Compensation Committee determines the annual bonus of the CEO based
upon the Corporation's sales, pretax income and return on investment
(collectively, the "Corporation Components") as well as upon a subjective factor
designed to reward individual performance independent of the Corporation
Components. The CEO's bonus is determined in part based upon the Corporation's
attaining certain threshold, target and maximum Corporation Component levels,
which levels are established based upon a Board-approved business plan for the
Corporation. The CEO's fiscal 1997 bonus was determined by weighting the
Corporation Components as follows: 45% of his 1997 bonus was based upon the
levels of Corporation Components achieved (each bearing equal weight) and 55%
was determined subjectively based upon the CEO's overall contributions to the
Corporation.
 
     Stock options are awarded to the Corporation's executive officers in
accordance with plans approved by the Shareholders. During the fiscal year ended
February 28, 1997, options were available for grant only under the Corporation's
1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1995 Plan"). Subject to certain
limitations and based upon management input, the Compensation Committee
determines the persons to whom options will be granted and the numbers of shares
to be represented by such options. In general, the Compensation Committee has
awarded options based upon the individual's position with the Corporation and
potential contribution to corporate profitability. The 1995 Plan provides for
the granting of incentive stock options for Common Shares, the option price of
which may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares on the
date of grant. However, in the case of an optionee who owns or is deemed to own
shares of the Corporation representing more than 10% of the total voting power
of all classes of the Corporation's shares at the time an option is granted
(currently the CEO and two other executive officers), the option price may not
be less than 110% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant.
During the

<PAGE>   9
 
fiscal year ended February 28, 1997, no stock options were granted under the
1995 Plan to the named executive officers.
 
     Stock options also have been granted to certain executive officers pursuant
to their employment agreements with the Corporation. Such options were designed
to tie the interests of such executive officers, as new employees of the
Corporation, to the interest of the Corporation's Shareholders and to retain
those executive officers by linking the exercisability of their options to their
continued employment with the Corporation.
 
     In addition, the Corporation has adopted for many of its employees various
benefit plans in which the executive officers are permitted to participate,
subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the
benefits that may be payable under the plans.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
 
     The following graph compares total Shareholder returns in respect of the
Corporation's Common Shares ("TNZ") over the last five fiscal years to the
American Stock Exchange Index ("AMEX") and the Standard & Poor's Paper & Forest
Products Index ("S&P Paper & Forest"). In prior years, the graph compared total
shareholders returns of the Corporation's Class A and Class B Common Shares to
the American Stock Exchange Consumer Goods Index rather than the S&P Paper &
Forest. The Corporation has been advised that the AMEX Consumer Goods Index is
no longer maintained by AMEX. Accordingly, the Corporation is unable to include
information in respect of such Index in this Proxy Statement. In August 1996,
all of the Corporation's Class B Common Shares were converted into Class A
Common Shares and the Class A Common Shares were redesignated "Common Shares."
Total return values for AMEX, S&P Paper & Forest and TNZ were calculated based
upon market weighting at the beginning of the period and include reinvestment of
dividends. The Shareholder returns shown on the graph below are not necessarily
indicative of future performance.
 
     The following graph shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any
general statement incorporating by reference this proxy statement into any
filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, except to the extent the Corporation specifically incorporates this
information by reference and otherwise shall not be deemed filed under such
Acts.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS
 
     In 1990, the Corporation entered into employment agreements with Robert S.
Reitman and Morton L. Reitman. Robert S. Reitman's employment agreement, which
expires in June 1998, currently provides for an annual salary of $425,000, which
salary may be reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine
if the same should be increased. Robert S. Reitman's employment agreement also
provides for payment to Mr. Reitman of an annual incentive based upon certain
performance criteria, the maximum of which amount shall be not less than
$160,000, and for certain disability benefits.
 
     Morton L. Reitman's employment agreement with the Corporation, which
expires in June 1998, currently provides for an annual salary of $303,000, which
salary may be reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine
if the same should be increased, and for certain disability benefits. Morton L.
Reitman also has a consultant agreement with the Corporation providing for
payment to Mr. Reitman for consulting services in the amount of $72,000 per
year, for a term of three years commencing upon the termination of his
employment.
 
     In July 1992, the Corporation entered into an employment agreement with
Richard J. Sims, which expires in June 1998. Mr. Sims' employment agreement
currently provides for an annual salary of $245,000 (which salary may be
reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine if the same
should be increased), plus incentives based upon performance. In addition,
pursuant to Mr. Sims' employment agreement, the Corporation granted to Mr. Sims
options to purchase 25,000 Common Shares of the Corporation, the exercise price
of which options is $14.6875, the fair market value of such shares on the date
of grant. The options became or become exercisable (so long as Mr. Sims shall be
a full-time employee of the Corporation on such date) as follows: 5,000 options
on March 1, 1995; 6,000 options on March 1, 1996; and 7,000 options on March 1
of each of 1997 and 1998.
 
     In March 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation entered into an
employment agreement with Mr. Dennis H. Kelly. Mr. Kelly's employment agreement,
which expires in February 1999, currently provides for an annual salary of
$124,000 plus incentives based upon performance.
 
     The Corporation also has deferred compensation agreements with certain key
employees which provide for benefits for a term of 10 years following
retirement, disability or death. These benefits vary according to the employee's
corporate respon-
 
                                       11
<PAGE>   14
 
sibility and the age of the employee at the date of such event. The ranges of
annual benefits under the deferred compensation agreements for Messrs. Robert S.
Reitman and Morton L. Reitman during the first five years of said term are
$37,200 to $68,400 and $16,800 to $36,600, respectively. The amount of benefits
payable to such executive officers during the second five years of the term is
75% of the benefit payable during the first five years.
 
     The benefits payable to Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and Morton L. Reitman
under the deferred compensation agreements will be replaced with the benefits
payable to them under the Corporation's 1992 Supplemental Benefit Plan (the
"Supplemental Benefit Plan") upon the vesting of each such individual's rights
in that plan. Vesting under the Supplemental Benefit Plan does not occur unless
and until that individual has been a participant in the plan for 10 years or has
attained age 65, whichever first occurs; provided, however, that a participant
who becomes disabled or dies shall be vested after six years of employment by
the Corporation. In addition, in the event that effective control of the
Corporation changes from that management in control at the date of adoption of
the Supplemental Benefit Plan, all participants immediately vest in the plan
benefits. Under the Supplemental Benefit Plan, Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and
Morton L. Reitman will receive $140,000 and $60,000, respectively, in annual
benefits for a term of 15 years following their retirement, death or disability.
In the event that either individual's rights under the Supplemental Benefit Plan
fail to vest, then the benefits under the deferred compensation agreements
remain payable to such non-vested individual.
 
     In October 1996, the Corporation adopted and established the Supplemental
Retirement and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Supplemental
Retirement Plan") which provides for supplemental retirement income and deferred
compensation on a pre-tax basis to certain key employees. Participants in the
Supplemental Retirement Plan may elect to defer up to fifteen percent (15%) of
his or her annual federal taxable wages. Distributions will be made upon
termination of employment with the Corporation or the financial hardship of the
participant. In November 1996, Mr. Sims, a participant, deferred $15,000
pursuant to the Supplemental Retirement Plan.
 
                     BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF COMMON SHARES
 
     The following tables, together with the accompanying footnotes, describe
the beneficial ownership of the Corporation's Common Shares as of April 25, 1997
(except as otherwise indicated) of (1) each person who was known to the
Corporation to be
 
                                       12
<PAGE>   15
 
the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the total Common Shares issued
and outstanding on such date, (2) each current Director and nominee for election
as Director, as well as all executive officers and Directors as a group and (3)
all Shareholders, other than Current Directors, nominees and executive officers,
as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, the share figures shown below are
based upon information supplied by the named individuals and group members
described in the tables and the Corporation's records.
 
     As used in the tables, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of all
shares in respect of which such person has or shares voting or investment power
(regardless of whether such individual is entitled to receive any economic
benefits derived from such shares). As used herein, "voting power" means the
power to vote, or to direct the voting of, shares and "investment power" means
the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, shares. Also, included
are shares which were not owned on April 25, 1997 but which can be acquired
within 60 days after that date.
 
     As indicated specifically in the footnotes to the tables, certain Common
Shares included for the named individuals in each table below are deemed to be
beneficially owned by more than one of such named individuals and, as a result,
have been so reported. Certain individuals listed in the tables have disclaimed
beneficial ownership with respect to some of the Common Shares disclosed as
beneficially owned under the definition set forth above.

                             SELECTION OF AUDITORS
 
     The Board of Directors of the Corporation has recommended that KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP be selected as independent auditors to examine the books, records
and accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending
February 28, 1998. In accordance with past practice, the recommendation is being
presented to holders of Common Shares for adoption or rejection at the Annual
Meeting. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP were the independent auditors of the Corporation
for the fiscal year ended February 28, 1997 and are considered by the Board of
Directors to be well qualified. Representatives of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP are
expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a
statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to
appropriate questions.
 
                        COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF
                      THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
 
     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
Corporation's executive officers and Directors, and persons who beneficially own
more than 10% of the Corporation's Common Shares, to file reports of ownership
and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dennis H.
Kelly reported the exercise of stock options in December, 1996 subsequent to the
due date for such reporting.

                                 OTHER MATTERS
 
     The Board of Directors knows of no matter to be presented for action at the
Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. Should other
matters come before the meeting, the Common Shares represented by proxies
solicited hereby will be voted with respect thereto in accordance with the best
judgment of the proxy holders.
 
                              GENERAL INFORMATION
 
CUMULATIVE VOTING
 
     If notice in writing is given by any holder of Common Shares to the
President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Corporation, not less than
forty-eight hours before the time fixed for the holding of the Annual Meeting,
that such Shareholder desires that the voting with respect to the election of
Directors shall be cumulative, and if an announcement of the giving of such
notice is made upon the convening of the meeting by the Chairman or Secretary of
the Meeting or by or on behalf of the Shareholder giving such notice, each
holder of Common Shares shall have the right to cumulate such voting power as he
or she possesses at such election. If the Shareholder desires to make the
foregoing announcement at the convening of the meeting, such Shareholder must be
present in person or through a properly authorized representative other than
those persons designated in the accompanying form of proxy.
 
VOTING OF PROXIES
 
     Common Shares represented by properly executed Management proxies will be
voted at the meeting, and if a holder of such shares has specified how the same
are to be voted, they will be voted in accordance with such specification. It is
intended that Common Shares represented by proxies in which no specification has
been made will be voted for the election of Directors and for the selection of
the independent auditors.
 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
 
     If a holder of Common Shares intends to present a proposal at the next
Annual Meeting of Shareholders presently scheduled for June 15, 1998, it must be
received by the Corporation for consideration for inclusion in the Corporation's
Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting on or before January
14, 1998.

<PAGE>   21
 
REVOCATION OF PROXIES
 
     A proxy may be revoked at any time before a vote is taken or the authority
granted is otherwise exercised. Revocation may be accomplished by the execution
of a later proxy with regard to the same Common Shares or by giving notice in
writing or in open meeting.
 
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
 
     The cost of soliciting the accompanying proxies will be borne by the
Corporation. The Corporation does not expect to pay any compensation for the
solicitation of proxies but may pay brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and
custodians their reasonable expenses for sending proxy material to principals
and obtaining their instructions. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies
may be solicited in person, by telephone or telegraph, or by Directors, officers
and regular employees of the Corporation.
