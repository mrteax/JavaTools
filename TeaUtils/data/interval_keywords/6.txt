<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March&nbsp;18, 2005 are entitled to notice
of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of that date, the Company had
outstanding 2,539,442 shares of Common Stock. The holders of a majority of such shares,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is
necessary before business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting except that, even if a quorum is
not present, the shareholders present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Each shareholder entitled to vote shall have
the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock outstanding in such shareholder&#146;s name.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed Proxy Card will be voted at
the Annual Meeting in the manner directed therein by the shareholder signing such Proxy Card. The
Proxy Card provides a space for a shareholder to vote for the Board&#146;s nominee, or to withhold
authority to vote for such nominee, for election as the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;IV director. The Class&nbsp;IV
director is to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. With respect to
any other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote thereon is required to take action,
unless a greater percentage is required either by law or by the Company&#146;s Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws. In determining the number of votes cast with respect to any voting
matter, only those cast &#147;for&#148; or &#147;against&#148; are included. Abstentions will be considered present
and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting but will not be counted as votes cast. Accordingly,
abstentions will have no effect on the vote. Similarly, where

authority in voting shares on certain matters for beneficial owners who have not provided voting
instructions with respect to such matters (commonly referred to as &#147;broker non-votes&#148;), those

recommended by the Board or its Executive Committee. Execution and return of the enclosed Proxy
Card will not affect a shareholder&#146;s right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. Any
shareholder that executes and returns a Proxy Card has the right to revoke it by giving notice of
revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time before the proxy is voted.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board currently consists of five directors and is classified with respect to terms of
office into four classes. The Class&nbsp;IV director elected at the Annual Meeting will serve until the
2009 annual meeting of shareholders and until such director&#146;s successor has been elected and
qualified, except in the event of such director&#146;s earlier death, resignation or removal. The terms
of office of the Class&nbsp;I, Class&nbsp;II and Class&nbsp;III directors will expire at the annual meetings of
shareholders to be held in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, upon the election and qualification

Executive Officer. The persons named as proxy agents in the enclosed Proxy Card intend (unless
instructed otherwise by a shareholder) to vote for the election of Mr.&nbsp;Cloues as the Class&nbsp;IV
director. In the event that the nominee should become unable to accept nomination or election (a
circumstance that the Board does not expect), the proxy agents intend to vote for any alternate
nominee designated by the Board or its Executive Committee or, in the discretion of the Board or
its Executive Committee, the position may be left vacant.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Committees and Meetings</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has an Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and a Compensation and Human
Resources Committee. The members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee also constitute
the members of the two committees that administer the Company&#146;s equity compensation plans

Resources Committee held three meetings, including one telephonic meeting and one joint telephonic
meeting with the Board, the Stock Option Committee did not meet separately from the Compensation
and Human Resources Committee and the Executive Committee held one telephonic meeting. Each
director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the fiscal year 2004 meetings of the Board and
of the Board committee or committees on which he served during the year. The Company had a
Nominating Committee until the death of one its members in 2001; since that time, the full Board
has assumed

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) adopted new rules and regulations in late 2003 relating to
corporate governance and listing requirements, the Board reconsidered its decision not to have a
formal Nominating Committee and determined that this decision was appropriate based on a number of
factors, including the size of the current Board, the number of independent directors and the
existing commitments of those independent directors to other Board committees. In addition, the
Board determined that recommendations regarding future director nominations, including nominations
as a result of vacancies, would be made by a majority of the Company&#146;s independent directors and
that the final selection would be made by the entire Board.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive Committee is empowered to exercise all powers of the Board, except action on
dividends and certain other matters that cannot by law be delegated by the Board, during the
periods between regular Board meetings. The primary purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist
the Board in its oversight of the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company, the
audits of the financial statements of the Company and the Company&#146;s compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements; to interact directly with and evaluate the performance of the Company&#146;s
independent registered public accounting firm, including to determine whether to engage or dismiss
the independent registered public accounting firm and to monitor the independent registered public
accounting firm&#146;s qualifications and independence; and to prepare the report required by the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be included in the Company&#146;s annual
proxy statement. As for the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, its main purposes are to
establish and periodically review the Company&#146;s compensation philosophy and the adequacy of
compensation plans and programs for executive officers and other employees; to establish
compensation arrangements for executive officers and to administer compensation plans; to review
the performance of executive officers and award incentive compensation and adjust compensation
arrangements as appropriate based upon its assessment of such performance; to review and monitor
management development and succession plans and activities; and to prepare the report on executive
compensation for inclusion in the Company&#146;s annual proxy statement in accordance with Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. The Stock Option Committee is responsible for
administering the Company&#146;s 1996 Equity Compensation Plan and another stock option plan that has
expired but under which there remain outstanding stock options.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current members of the Executive Committee are Messrs.&nbsp;Cloues (Chairman) and Cohen; of the
Audit Committee, Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola (Chairman), Engel and Hurd; of the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee, Messrs.&nbsp;Cohen (Chairman) and Pinola; and of the Stock Option Committee, Messrs.&nbsp;Cohen
and Pinola.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Affirmative Determination Regarding Director Independence and Other Corporate Governance Matters</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company operates within a comprehensive plan of corporate governance for the purpose of
defining director independence, assigning Board responsibilities, setting high standards of
professional and personal conduct for directors, officers and employees and assuring compliance
with such responsibilities and standards. The Company regularly monitors developments in the area
of corporate governance. In July&nbsp;2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which, among
other things, established or provided the basis for a number of new corporate governance standards
and disclosure requirements. In addition, Nasdaq also adopted changes to its corporate governance
and listing requirements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has determined that the following directors, constituting four of the Company&#146;s five
directors and thus a majority of the Board, are each an &#147;independent director&#148; as such term is
defined in Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4200(a)(15) of the National Association of Securities Dealers (the
&#147;NASD&#148;): Norman Cohen, Robert A. Engel, Edward T. Hurd and Richard J. Pinola. The Board also has
determined that each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee
and the Stock Option Committee meets the independence requirements applicable to those committees
as prescribed by the NASD, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and
applicable committee charters. The Board has further determined that Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola and Engel, who
are two of the three members of the Audit Committee, are each an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148;
as such term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation&nbsp;S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Statement of Corporate Ethics and Code of Business Conduct</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has adopted a Statement of Corporate Ethics and Code of Business Conduct applicable
to all directors, officers and employees of the Company. Violations of the Statement of Corporate
Ethics and Code of Business Conduct may be reported to the Company&#146;s Corporate Ethics Officer or,
in cases involving accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, to the Chairperson
of the Audit Committee or the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer. A copy of the Statement of
Corporate Ethics and Code of Business Conduct can be obtained from our Internet web site at
http://www.ktron.com, without charge.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Standard Compensation Arrangements</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors who are not employees of the Company receive an annual retainer of $15,000, a $2,000
annual retainer for each membership on the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee, a $1,000 annual retainer for membership on the Executive Committee, $1,000 for each
Board meeting attended and $750 for each Executive Committee meeting attended provided that, in the
case of an Executive Committee meeting, such meeting either requires substantial preparation or
lasts for two hours or more. In addition, the Chairperson of the Audit Committee and the
Chairperson of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are each paid an additional $1,500
retainer for their service in such capacities. All retainers are paid on a prorated bi-monthly
basis. Directors generally do not receive compensation for their participation in telephone
meetings or for attendance at other committee meetings. Under the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan,
non-employee directors are eligible to receive stock options and, unless the Stock Option Committee
determines otherwise (which has not been the case in the past), on the date of each annual meeting
of shareholders of the Company, each non-employee director receives a stock option grant to
purchase 1,000 shares of Common Stock with an option price per share equal to the fair market value
of a share of Common Stock on that date. Such options are fully vested on the date of grant and
have a ten-year term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Share Ownership Guideline</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each non-employee director is required to own shares of Common Stock with a value, at the
greater of cost or market, equal to $50,000. As for any newly-elected director, this requirement
may be phased in over a period of time to be determined by the Board. All directors are in
compliance with this guideline with the exception of Mr.&nbsp;Hurd, who, as of March&nbsp;18, 2005, owned
1,500 shares with a market value of $45,300.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Directors&#146; Attendance at Annual Meeting of Shareholders</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been and is the policy of the Board that all directors attend the annual meeting of
shareholders except where the failure to attend is due to unavoidable circumstances or conflicts
discussed in advance by such director with the Chairman of the Board. All members of the Board
attended the 2004 annual meeting of shareholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Communication with the Board</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board provides a process for shareholders to send communications to the Board.
Information regarding the manner in which a shareholder may communicate with the Board is included
on our Internet web site at http://www.ktron.com.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Requirements for Director Nominations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By resolution, the Board has adopted a policy regarding director nominations. Under this
policy, a majority of the Company&#146;s independent directors shall recommend for the Board&#146;s selection
a candidate or candidates, as appropriate, to be the Board&#146;s nominee or nominees for election as a
director or directors, either at an annual meeting of shareholders or to fill a vacancy. In
considering candidates for nomination, the Board shall seek individuals who evidence strength of
character, mature judgment and the ability to work collegially with others. Furthermore, it is the
policy of the Board that it endeavor to have directors who collectively possess a broad range of
skills, expertise, industry and other knowledge and business and other experience useful to the
effective oversight of the Company&#146;s business; therefore, in considering whether to nominate a
person for election as a director, the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">independent directors and the Board will consider, among other factors, the contribution such
person can make to the collective competencies of the Board based on such person&#146;s background. In
determining whether to nominate a current director for reelection, the independent directors and
the Board will take into account these same criteria as well as the director&#146;s past performance,
including his or her participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will also consider candidates for nomination recommended by shareholders provided
that the shareholder submits the recommendation, along with the following information, to the
Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company at least 120&nbsp;days before
the date on which the Company first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year&#146;s annual meeting
of shareholders: (a)&nbsp;the name of the candidate and the information about the individual that would
be required to be included in a proxy statement under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission; (b)&nbsp;information about the relationship between the candidate and the shareholder making
the recommendation; (c)&nbsp;the consent of the candidate to serve as a director; and (d)&nbsp;proof of the
number of shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock that the shareholder making the recommendation owns
and the length of time the shares have been owned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Requirements for Advance Notification of Director Nominations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;Ninth of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company provides that no
person may be nominated for election as a director by a shareholder at an annual or special meeting
unless written notice of such shareholder&#146;s intent to make such nomination has been given, either
by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Company at
the principal executive offices of the Company not later than (a)&nbsp;with respect to an election to be
held at an annual meeting of shareholders, 90&nbsp;days in advance of such meeting and (b)&nbsp;with respect
to an election to be held at a special meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, the
close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first
given to shareholders. Each such notice shall set forth: (a)&nbsp;the name and address of the
shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b)&nbsp;a
representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote
at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person
or persons specified in the notice; (c)&nbsp;a description of all arrangements or understandings between
the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons)
pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (d)&nbsp;such other
information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included
in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; and (e)&nbsp;the consent of
each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. The Board may, in its
discretion, consider nominees for the Board who are recommended by a shareholder according to the
foregoing procedure, but it is not obligated to do so, and the chairman of the meeting may refuse
to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with such procedure.

fiscal year 2004 under employment agreements with the Company (the &#147;Employment Agreements&#148;). Under
the Employment Agreements, Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt are entitled to receive an annual
base salary, which may be increased from time to time, and such additional compensation, including
bonus payments, as may be awarded to them. On February&nbsp;23, 2004, the Compensation and Human
Resources Committee of the Board (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) approved 2.5% increases in the
annual base salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick and Guenthardt to $228,400, $207,700 and $201,800,
effective April&nbsp;5, 2004, and on March&nbsp;4, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved 2%, 7.2% and
2.1% increases in these annual base salaries to $233,000, $222,700 and $206,000, effective

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">April&nbsp;4, 2005. The Company&#146;s obligation to pay such base salaries is subject to its right to
reduce them in the event reductions are generally being made for other officers of the Company or
its subsidiaries holding comparable positions.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the Employment Agreements provides that either the Company or the employee may
terminate the employment term thereunder upon not less than one year&#146;s prior written notice. Such
employment terms are also subject to termination by reason of the employee&#146;s death or disability or
by the Board at any time for &#147;cause&#148; as specified in the Employment Agreements. In addition, the
Company has the right to terminate any of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick or Guenthardt at any time without
cause by paying him a lump sum amount equal to 100% of his then-annual base salary or, if the
previously described one-year notice of termination has already been given by the Company to him,
the portion thereof relating to the balance of his employment term.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Cloues was employed by the Company during fiscal year 2004 under an employment agreement
with the Company pursuant to which he served as the Company&#146;s Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer. Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved a
2.5% increase in Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; annual base salary to $475,000, effective April&nbsp;5, 2004, and on March
4, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved an additional 2% increase to $484,500, effective April
4, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; employment agreement provides that he can terminate the agreement upon not less
than 90&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice. The Company may terminate the employment term without cause
upon not less than 30&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice to Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, in which case Mr.&nbsp;Cloues would be
entitled to a lump sum payment equal to 200% of his then-annual base salary. Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146;
employment term is also subject to termination by reason of his death or disability or by the Board
at any time for &#147;cause&#148; as specified in his employment agreement. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146;
employment agreement includes provisions relating to a termination of employment upon a &#147;change of
control&#148; (as specified in his employment agreement). These provisions apply to a termination of
employment upon or within one year after a &#147;change of control&#148; which, if such termination was
initiated by the Company or any successor thereto, was for any reason other than death, disability
or &#147;cause&#148; or which, if such termination was initiated by Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, was at his sole discretion
without regard to reason. In the event of the termination of employment of Mr.&nbsp;Cloues upon a
&#147;change of control&#148; under any of these circumstances, his employment agreement provides that,
subject to certain limitations, the Company would pay him (a)&nbsp;an amount equal to three times his
annual base salary in effect either immediately prior to the termination of employment or
immediately prior to the &#147;change of control,&#148; whichever is higher, and (b)&nbsp;unless Mr.&nbsp;Cloues
notifies the Company in writing that he intends to retain his options, an amount equal to the
spread (the excess of market value over exercise price) on any stock options then held by him,
whether or not such options were exercisable at the date of termination.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;) operates
pursuant to a formal written charter that was approved and adopted by the Board on March&nbsp;12, 2004
and complies with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of

caption &#147;Matters Concerning Directors &#150; Committees and Meetings&#148; and in the charter referred to
above that is included on the Company&#146;s Internet web site at http://www.ktron.com. In particular,
it is our duty to establish annual base salary amounts and annual and long-term incentive awards

(the &#147;Stock Option Committee&#148;) that administers the Company&#146;s equity compensation plans, including
the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to officers and other
employees of the Company. In fulfilling these responsibilities and duties, it is the Compensation
Committee&#146;s goal to have a policy that will enable the Company to attract, retain and reward senior
officers who contribute to both its short-term and long-term success. The two members of the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Association of Securities Dealers, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal
Revenue Service and also as set forth in the Compensation Committee&#146;s charter.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s compensation policy for executive officers is to pay competitively and to be
fair and equitable in the administration of pay. This is the same policy applicable to all
employees of the Company. The Company seeks to balance the compensation paid to a particular
individual with the compensation paid to other executives holding comparable positions both inside
the Company and at other similar companies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisions of the Compensation Committee regarding salaries of the executive officers are
subjective and not based on any list of specific criteria. On February&nbsp;23, 2004, as reported by
the Compensation Committee in last year&#146;s Proxy Statement, the Committee accepted the Chief
Executive Officer&#146;s recommendation that the annual base salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick,
Melchiorre and Guenthardt be increased by approximately 2.5% each, effective April&nbsp;5, 2004. The
Chief Executive Officer&#146;s recommendation to increase the annual base salaries of these executive
officers was based upon his assessment of their contributions to the Company during fiscal year
2003. At the same time, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board a salary increase of
approximately 2.5% for Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, also to take effect on
April&nbsp;5, 2004, which increase was subsequently approved by the Board. The recommendation of the
Compensation Committee to increase the annual base salary of Mr.&nbsp;Cloues was based on a variety of
factors, including the Company&#146;s improved consolidated financial performance in fiscal year 2003,
the above average increase in its share price for the year, the successful integration of the
January&nbsp;2, 2003 Pennsylvania Crusher acquisition and the completion of the globalization of the
K-Tron Feeder Group. Following these April&nbsp;5, 2004 increases, Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; annual base salary was
$475,000, and the annual base salaries of Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick, Melchiorre and Guenthardt were
$228,400, $207,700, $205,000 and $201,800.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Compensation Committee accepted the Chief
Executive Officer&#146;s recommendation and approved increases in the annual base salaries of Messrs.
Bowen, Remick, Melchiorre and Guenthardt of approximately 2%, 7.2%, 7.3% and 2.1%, effective April
4, 2005, to $233,000, $222,700, $220,000 and $206,000. At the same time, the Compensation
Committee also approved a 2% increase in Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; annual base salary to $484,500, also effective
April&nbsp;4, 2005. The factors that the Compensation Committee took into account in approving the
Chief Executive Officer&#146;s salary increase as of April&nbsp;4, 2005 were the same as those described
below that were the basis for Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; bonus for fiscal year 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to granting salary increases in 2005, on March&nbsp;4, 2005 the Compensation Committee
also approved the payment of annual cash incentive awards for 2004 to the executive officers,
including the Chief Executive Officer. These awards were made pursuant to bonus guidelines used in
the preparation of the Company&#146;s budget for 2004. Although the budget was approved by the Board of
Directors, including both members of the Committee, the Committee retained full discretion to make
such specific incentive bonus awards, if any, as it deemed appropriate, after the end of the year.
The awards made were based on the Company&#146;s achievement of its earnings per share target for 2004,
the amount of pre-tax income generated by the Company in excess of what was necessary to achieve
that earnings per share target and the assessed contribution of each executive to the Company&#146;s
success. As a starting point, the Committee considered the target bonus for each executive used in
the 2004 budget, which was the same target bonus used for the past several years. This target was
50% of base salary for Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, and 30% of base salary
for the other executive officers, but the annual incentive award for any executive may be more or
less than the applicable target, depending on the Company&#146;s financial performance, the Committee&#146;s
assessment of the executive&#146;s contribution and such other factors as the Committee may choose to
consider.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, was awarded a $380,000 bonus for fiscal
year 2004, which was equal to 80% of his annual base salary at the end of the year. In determining
Mr.&nbsp;Cloues&#146; bonus, the Compensation Committee noted in particular his leadership of the Company in
2004, the achievement of record earnings per share, the substantial increase in cash and reduction
in debt during the year and several other specific financial accomplishments. The bonus awards
made to the four other executive officers were recommended by Mr.&nbsp;Cloues, based on his assessment
of their contributions to the Company in fiscal year 2004. For Messrs.&nbsp;Bowen, Remick, Melchiorre
and Guenthardt, their bonuses for fiscal year 2004 equaled approximately 52.5%, 52.5%, 52.5% and
37.5% of each of their annual base salaries at the end of fiscal year 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, the members of the Compensation Committee also serve as the members of the
Stock Option Committee that administers the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan under which grants of
stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock may be made. The purpose of such
grants is to provide an additional incentive to key employees to work to maximize shareholder
value, and vesting periods may be utilized to encourage such employees to remain with the Company.
Such grants are entirely at the discretion of the Stock Option Committee, including their timing,
the recipients thereof and the number of shares underlying any particular grant. No stock options
or stock appreciation rights were granted to any executive officer, including the Chief Executive
Officer, in 2004, but on April&nbsp;14, 2004 the Compensation Committee granted Messrs.&nbsp;Cloues, Bowen,
Remick, Melchiorre and Guenthardt 8,000, 4,000, 4,000, 4,000 and 4,000 shares of restricted Common
Stock. Each of these grants of restricted Common Stock will vest on April&nbsp;14, 2008 if the
recipient&#146;s employment by the Company or a subsidiary has not terminated for any reason before that
date, and they are subject to acceleration in the event of a change of control prior to that date
as defined in the Company&#146;s 1996 Equity Compensation Plan. These restricted stock grants to the
executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, were made to provide a long-term
incentive to these key employees and to more closely align their interests with those of the
Company&#146;s shareholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, we believe that the combination of salary, bonus and restricted stock received by
each of the executive officers for fiscal year 2004 was reasonable in view of that executive&#146;s
duties and responsibilities and his past and anticipated future contributions to the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a formal written charter that was most recently
approved and adopted by the Board on March&nbsp;12, 2004 and complies with the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers (the &#147;NASD&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with that charter and the independence criteria prescribed by applicable law and
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for audit committee membership,
all of the members of the Audit Committee are independent directors as defined in NASD Marketplace
Rule&nbsp;4200(a)(15). Each Audit Committee member meets the NASD&#146;s financial knowledge requirements,
and Messrs.&nbsp;Pinola and Engel, each of whom has been designated by the Board as an &#147;audit committee
financial expert&#148; pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, meet the NASD&#146;s
professional experience requirements as well.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of the Audit Committee are described on page 6 of this Proxy Statement under the
caption &#147;Matters Concerning Directors &#150; Committees and Meetings&#148; and in the charter of the Audit
Committee that is included on the Company&#146;s Internet web site at http://www.ktron.com. In
particular, it is our duty to review the accounting and financial reporting processes of the
Company on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling our responsibilities, the Audit Committee has
reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements to be contained in the
Company&#146;s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;1, 2005 with the Company&#146;s
management and also with Grant Thornton LLP, the Company&#146;s independent registered public accounting
firm. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including
the system of internal controls, and has represented to the Audit Committee that such financial
statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on
the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee has also discussed with Grant Thornton LLP the matters that are required
to be discussed by the auditors with the Audit Committee under Statement on Auditing Standards No.
61, as amended. Furthermore, the Audit Committee has received and discussed with the auditors
their annual written report on their independence from the Company and its management, which is
made under Rule&nbsp;3600T of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which adopts on an interim
basis Independence Standards Board Standard No.&nbsp;1

the compatibility of the provision by that firm of non-audit services to the Company with the
requirement of auditor independence.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts in an oversight capacity. The
Audit Committee reviews the Company&#146;s earnings releases before issuance and the annual report on
Form 10-K prior to filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In its oversight role, the
Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company&#146;s management, which has the
primary responsibility for financial statements and reports, and of the independent registered
public accountants, who, in their report, express an opinion on the conformity of the Company&#146;s
annual financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reliance on these reviews, discussions and reports, the Audit Committee has recommended to
the Board that the Company&#146;s audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company&#146;s
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January&nbsp;1, 2005 for filing with the Securities

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;13, 2003, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, pursuant to authority
delegated to it by the Board, dismissed KPMG LLP (&#147;KPMG&#148;) as our independent auditors and engaged
Grant Thornton LLP (&#147;Grant Thornton&#148;) to serve as the Company&#146;s independent auditors for the 2003
fiscal year ending January&nbsp;3, 2004. Grant Thornton audited our financial statements for fiscal
years 2003 and 2004. KPMG audited our financial statements for fiscal year 2002 and had been our
independent auditors since June&nbsp;22, 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;28, 2002, KPMG&#146;s report on our consolidated financial
statements did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and it was not qualified
or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that it contained a
separate paragraph stating, &#147;the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule of K-Tron International, Inc. and subsidiaries were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 7, these consolidated financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142, &#145;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,&#146; which was adopted
by the Company as of December&nbsp;30, 2001. In our opinion, such disclosures for fiscal 2001 and fiscal
2000 in Note 7 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review or apply any
procedures to the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule of K-Tron International, Inc. and subsidiaries other than with respect to such
disclosures, and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;28, 2002 and through August&nbsp;13, 2003, there were no
disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the former
auditors&#146; satisfaction, would have caused the former auditors to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreements in connection with their report on our consolidated financial
statements for fiscal year 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We disclosed the foregoing information with respect to KPMG in a current report on Form 8-K
filed August&nbsp;20, 2003 and amended in a current report on Form 8-K/A filed August&nbsp;25, 2003
(collectively, the &#147;KPMG Form&nbsp;8-K&#148;). We provided KPMG with a copy of this disclosure and requested
KPMG to furnish us with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating
whether KPMG agreed with the statements in the disclosure and, if not, stating the respects in
which it did not agree. KPMG issued a letter stating that it had read the pertinent paragraphs of
the KPMG Form 8-K and was in agreement with the statements contained therein, except

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">that KPMG said that it was not in a position to agree or disagree with our statement that
Grant Thornton was not engaged regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific
transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial
statements. KPMG&#146;s letter was filed as an exhibit to the KPMG Form&nbsp;8-K.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;28, 2002 and through August&nbsp;13, 2003, and during the
fiscal year ended December&nbsp;30, 2001 and through June&nbsp;22, 2002, we did not consult with Grant
Thornton or KPMG, respectively, with respect to the application of accounting principles to a
specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be
rendered on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable
events set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii)&nbsp;of Regulation&nbsp;S-K.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the retention of Grant Thornton LLP on August&nbsp;13, 2003, there have been no disagreements
with that firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to that firm&#146;s satisfaction,
would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection
with its report on our financial statements for fiscal year 2003 or fiscal year 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retention of Grant Thornton to serve as the Company&#146;s independent registered public
accounting firm for the current year has not yet been considered by the Audit Committee, but it is
management&#146;s belief that Grant Thornton will be so retained. No representative of Grant Thornton
is expected to attend the Annual Meeting.

it is received by the Company no later than December&nbsp;11, 2005 and if it complies with Securities

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other deadlines apply to the submission of shareholder proposals for the 2006 annual meeting
that are not required to be included in the Company&#146;s proxy statement under Securities and Exchange
Commission rules. With respect to shareholder proposals relating to director nominations, see page
8 of this Proxy Statement. With respect to other shareholder proposals for the 2006 annual
meeting, the deadline under regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission is
February&nbsp;25, 2006 (45 calendar days prior to the anniversary of the mailing date of this Proxy
Statement). If a shareholder gives notice of such a proposal after this deadline, the Company&#146;s
proxy agents will be allowed to use their discretionary voting authority to vote against the
shareholder proposal when and if the proposal is raised at the 2006 annual meeting.
