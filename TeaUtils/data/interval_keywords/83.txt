(l) Value of unexercised in-the-money options is based on the closing common 
stock price on June 30, 1995 of $14.75 as reported by NASDAQ.

On June 9, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors adopted resolutions 
amending the Company's Stock Option Plan ("the Plan"), in the following 
respects: the Plan is to be administered by a committee consisting of 
not less than three directors, all of whom shall be "disinterested persons";
a committee member shall be a "disinterested person" only if such person is 
not, at the time he exercises discretion in administering the Plan, eligible 
and has not at any time within one year prior thereto been eligible, 
for selection as a person as to whom options may be granted; and no option
may be granted to any director as to whom the proxy statement for the meeting 
of stockholders at which the Plan was submitted for approval of the 
stockholders of the Company disclosed that such director will not 
participate in the Plan.

On December 1, 1994, a committee consisting of Arnold Frankel, 
Stephen M. Goldstein and Samuel I. Hendler (Mr. Arnold Frankel to
be chairman of said committee) was appointed by the Board of Directors
to administer the Plan.  All of said directors were disinterested
persons as defined by the Plan.

Report of the Executive Compensation Committee

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose
members are Arnold Frankel, Robert E. Parsont and Samuel I.
Hendler, functions as the Executive Compensation Committee,
and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the
remuneration of the Company's executive officers.

The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable
the Company to attract, retain and motivate executives whose
enthusiasm and abilities will contribute to the growth of
its business and result in maximum profitability to the
Company and its shareholders, by providing salaries and
benefits competitive with those offered by other companies
in the chemical industry. The executive compensation program
includes base salary, annual incentive compensation (cash
bonuses), and long term incentive compensation (stock
options).

Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the
chemical industry. Because of the way that the Company
operates its business, the contributions of its executives
significantly affect corporate profitability. Bonuses (which
can exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of
such contributions. The bonuses paid to the Chairman, who is
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (CEO), the
President, who is the Chief Operating Officer (COO), and the
Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO), reflect the Company's overall performance (excluding
extraordinary events).  Another consideration is the
increase in corporate stature and shareholder value
developed over the years under their stewardship.

The three highest paid executive officers, after the CEO and
COO, are each responsible for the performance of one of the
Company's principal profit centers. Internally generated
performance records are kept on a monthly and yearly basis
for these profit centers, and each centers profitability is
compared in the current year to the previous year. Other
factors considered in determining the bonuses of individual
executives are the individual's own performance and the
overall performance of the Company. The Executive
Compensation Committee determines each bonus primarily based
on these data, also taking into account the long term
contributions of each individual.

The Company's Stock Option Plan is administered by directors
who do not receive stock options under the plan. Grants of
stock options, which vary according to annual and longer
term performance ratings, are made to senior and middle
management executives.

Chief Executive Officer's Compensation

The CEO's compensation was determined on the basis of the
same factors utilized to compensate other executives. The
CEO, a founder of the Company, does not participate in the
Company's Stock Option Plan.

     The Executive Compensation Committee
          Arnold Frankel, Chairman
          Robert E. Parsont
          Samuel I. Hendler

Director Compensation

Each non-employee director receives $7,500 per year for
serving on the Board of Directors. There is no additional
compensation for directors who are also employees.

Employment Agreements

There are no employment contracts with any director or
officer; however, Messrs. Baldi, Brunner, Parsont and
Schwartz have signed patent and trade secret agreements.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

By resolution of the Board, adopted on April 12, 1993, the
Company was authorized to purchase, during a three-year
period beginning May 24, 1993, on the open market or in
private transactions, up to 1,000,000 shares of its common
stock, in addition to purchases previously authorized by the
Board, at prices not to exceed the market value thereof at
the time of such purchase. On March 16, 1995, the Company
purchased from Robert E. Parsont, President and Chief
Operating Officer of the Company, 10,560 shares of its
common stock at $15 per share, aggregating $158,400. At the
date of such purchase the price of such common stock in the
over-the-counter market was $15 per share. The shares sold
by Mr. Parsont to the Company were acquired by him upon
exercise of stock options, at an exercise price of $2.27 per
share. Mr. Parsont's aggregate realized profit resulting
from this transaction was $134,400. On May 12, 1995, the
Company purchased from Donald Horowitz, Secretary/Treasurer
and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, 2,640 shares of
its common stock at $15 per share, aggregating $39,600. At
the date of such purchase the price of such common stock in
the over-the-counter market was $15 per share. The shares
sold by Mr. Horowitz to the Company were acquired by him
upon exercise of stock options, at an exercise price of
$7.58 per share. Mr. Horowitz' aggregate realized profit
resulting from this transaction was $19,600.

Samuel I. Hendler, a director of the Company, serves as
general counsel to the Company. Robert A. Wiesen, a director
of the Company, is a partner in the law firm of Clifton Budd
& DeMaria, which serves as labor and employment law counsel
to the Company.

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
requires the Company's directors and executive officers, and
persons who own more than 10% of the registered class of the
Company's equity securities to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC), initial reports of ownership
and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and
other equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors
and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC
regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section
16(a) forms they file. To the Company's knowledge, based
solely on review of the copies of such reports furnished to
the Company and representations that no other reports were
required during the fiscal year, all Section 16(a) filing
requirements applicable to its officers, directors and
greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with.

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP was the Company's principal accountant
for the Company's most recent fiscal year ended June 30,
1995. Representatives of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP are expected
to be present at the Stockholder's Meeting with an
opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so.
Such representatives are also expected to be available to
respond to appropriate questions.

The Company has not as yet selected its principal accountant
for its current fiscal year since such selection is usually
made by the Company's Board of Directors late in the fiscal
year. At present, management has no reason to believe that
there will be any change in its principal accountant for the
current fiscal year.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Any proposal which a stockholder intends to present at the
1996 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be duly received by
the Company on or before June 14, 1996.
