On June 9, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors adopted resolutions amending
the Company's 1980 Stock Option Plan (the Option Plan), in the following
respects: the Plan is to be administered by a committee consisting of not less
than three directors, all of whom shall be "disinterested persons"; a committee
member shall be a "disinterested person" only if such person is not, at the
time he exercises discretion in administering the Option Plan, eligible, and
has not at any time within one year prior thereto been eligible, for selection
as a person as to whom options may be granted; and no option may be granted to
any director as to whom the proxy statement for the meeting of stockholders at
which the Option Plan was submitted for approval of the stockholders of the
Company disclosed that such director will not participate in the Option Plan.

On December 10, 1998, a committee consisting of Samuel I. Hendler (Chairman),
Stephen M. Goldstein and Robert A. Wiesen was appointed by the Board of
Directors to administer the Option Plan. All of said directors were
disinterested persons as defined by the Option Plan.

The Company's 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan is administered by the Executive
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are Leonard S.
Schwartz (Chairman), Stephen M. Goldstein, Samuel I. Hendler and Robert A.
Wiesen, functions as the Executive Compensation Committee, and makes
recommendations to the Board with respect to the remuneration of the Company's
executive officers.

The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the Company to
attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and abilities will
contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum profitability to
the Company and its stockholders, by providing salaries and benefits
competitive with those offered by other companies in the chemical industry.
The executive compensation program includes base salary, annual incentive
compensation (cash bonuses), and long term incentive compensation (awards under
the Company's Omnibus Equity Award Plan).

Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the chemical industry.
Because of the way that the Company operates its business, the contributions of
its executives significantly affect corporate profitability.  Bonuses (which
can exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such contributions.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) also is the President and Chief Operating
Officer (COO) of the Company.  The bonuses paid to the CEO and to the
Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), reflect the
Company's overall performance (excluding extraordinary events).

The three highest paid executives, other than the CEO and CFO, are each
responsible for the performance of one of the Company's principal profit
centers.  Internally generated performance records are kept on a monthly and
yearly basis for these profit centers, and each center's profitability is
compared in the current year to the previous year.  Other factors considered in
determining the bonuses of individual executives are the individual's own
performance and the overall performance of the Company.  The Executive
Compensation Committee determines each bonus primarily based on this data, also
taking into account the long term contributions of each individual.


CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION

The CEO's compensation was determined on the basis of the same factors utilized
to compensate other executives, taking into account total compensation
comparisons of top executives of corporations considered to be in the Company's
peer group.

      The Executive Compensation Committee
            Leonard S. Schwartz, Chairman
            Stephen M. Goldstein
            Samuel I. Hendler
            Robert A. Wiesen

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Each non-employee director receives $10,000 per year for serving on the Board
of Directors plus $500 for each committee meeting attended. There is no
additional compensation for directors who are also employees.

Each of the non-employee directors, Messrs. Hendler, Wiesen and Goldstein,
received stock options under the 1998 Aceto Corporation Omnibus Equity Award
Plan.  Each stock option was for 1,000 shares at a strike price of $12.50 and
expires ten years from the date of grant.  At June 30, 1999, the closing price
of Aceto Corporation common stock was $11.50.  The options were not in-the-
money.


EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

There are no employment contracts with any director, nominee for election as
director, or officer; however, Messrs. Amitrano, Baldi, Brunner and Schwartz
have signed patent and trade secret agreements.

STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH

Shown below is a line graph comparing the yearly percentage change in the

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

Samuel I. Hendler, a director of the Company, serves as general counsel to the
Company. Robert A. Wiesen, a director of the Company, is a partner in the law
firm of Clifton Budd & DeMaria, which serves as labor and employment law
counsel of the Company.




SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's
directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of the
registered class of the Company's equity securities to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), initial reports of ownership and reports
of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the
Company. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by
SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file. To the Company's knowledge, based solely on review of the copies of
such reports furnished to the Company and representations that no other reports
were required during the fiscal year, all Section 16(a) filing requirements
applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners
were complied with.

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board has again appointed the firm of KPMG LLP as independent auditors for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.  A representative of KPMG LLP will be
present at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to respond to appropriate
questions from stockholders and will have the opportunity to make a statement,
if he so desires.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Any proposal which a stockholder intends to present at the 2000 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders must be duly received by the Company on or before June 2, 2000.

The Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended June 30, 1999 is
being mailed to stockholders with this Proxy Statement.
