PROXY STATEMENT
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
October 14, 1998
 
                                  SOLICITATION
 
This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card were mailed to shareholders on
or about August 21, 1998, in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
Board of Directors of the Company to be used at the 1998 Annual Meeting.
 
The cost of the solicitation of proxies will be paid by the Company. The Company
has engaged D. F. King & Co., 77 Water Street, New York, New York, to aid in the
solicitation of proxies at a total estimated cost of $7,500, plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. D. F. King & Co. may solicit proxies by mail, by
telephone, by facsimile, by e-mail, or in person. Certain officers, directors
and employees of the Company may also solicit proxies.
 
You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is exercised by voting in
person at the Annual Meeting or delivering a later dated, signed proxy to the
Secretary of the Company. Proxies will be voted in accordance with instructions
on the proxy. If no instructions are specified, the named proxy holder will vote
FOR Proposal 1, the election of the three nominees for director designated by
the Board, and upon any other matter that may properly come before the Annual
Meeting in their discretion and best judgment. The Board may nominate another
person if any nominee becomes unavailable for election for any reason prior to
the Annual Meeting vote. In that event, the named proxy holders will vote FOR
that other person.
 
                  RECORD DATE AND VOTING AT THE ANNUAL MEETING
 
Stockholders owning Common Stock of the Company ("Common Stock") outstanding at
the close of business on the record date, August 17, 1998, may vote at the 1998
Annual Meeting. On that date, 27,707,271 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding. Stockholders will have one vote on each matter to be voted on for
each share held on the record date. Shares cannot be voted unless the owner is
present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. The holders of a majority
of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or
represented by proxy will constitute a quorum. Votes cast in person or by proxy
will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed for the Annual
Meeting. The inspectors of election will treat directions to withhold authority,
abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are present and entitled to vote
for purposes of determining a quorum. Directions to withhold authority will have
no effect on the election of directors, because directors are elected by a
plurality of votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded
for purposes of determining whether a matter has been approved, because they are
not considered votes cast.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company provide
that the Board shall consist of between three and fifteen directors. The exact
number of directors is fixed from time to time by the Board and is presently set
at ten. The ten members of the Board are divided into three classes: Class I (3
directors), Class II (3 directors) and Class III (4 directors). One class is
elected each year for a three-year term.
 
The business, property, and affairs of the Company are managed under the
direction of the Board. Directors are kept informed of the Company's business
through discussions with the Chairman of the Board, the President and Chief
Executive Officer, and other officers of the Company, by reviewing materials
provided to them and by participating in meetings of the Board and its
committees.
 
During the fiscal year ended May 31, 1998 ("Fiscal 1998"), the Board held five
meetings. All of the incumbent directors attended 75% or more of the meetings of
the Board and of the Committees on which they served.
 
BOARD COMMITTEES
 
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, an Executive
Committee, and a Nominating Committee.
 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
 
The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. Its members
are Edgar D. Jannotta (Chairman), Robert D. Judson, Erwin E. Schulze, Joel D.
Spungin, and Howard B. Bernick. This committee recommends to the Board the
independent auditors who audit the Company's books and records, maintains
communication between the Board and its independent auditors,
monitors performance of the independent auditors, reviews financial reporting
issues and practices, reviews the adequacy of financial accounting controls and
the organization and performance of the Company's internal systems of audit,
reviews the scope and results of audits, and meets with the independent auditors
and internal auditors without members of management present. The Audit Committee
held three meetings during Fiscal 1998.
 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
 
The Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. Its
members are Erwin E. Schulze (Chairman), A. Robert Abboud, Edgar D. Jannotta,
Robert D. Judson and Lee B. Stern. This committee reviews and approves
compensation policies and practices for all elected corporate officers, fixes
the compensation of the Chairman of the Board and the President and Chief
Executive Officer, and administers the Chief Executive Officer's long-term
incentive program, the annual incentive compensation programs for other
officers, and the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan. The Compensation Committee held
six meetings during Fiscal 1998.
 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
 
The Executive Committee is comprised of Ira A. Eichner (Chairman), Edgar D.
Jannotta, Erwin E. Schulze and David P. Storch. The Executive Committee is
authorized to meet between meetings of the Board of Directors and exercise the
powers of the Board, subject to limitations imposed by law and by the Board. The
Executive Committee held three meetings during Fiscal 1998.
 
NOMINATING COMMITTEE
 
The Nominating Committee is comprised of Robert D. Judson (Chairman), Ira A.
Eichner, Lee B. Stern, and Richard D. Tabery. This committee recommends to the
Board qualified candidates for election as directors and considers the
performance of incumbent directors to determine whether they should be
recommended to the Board for nomination for reelection. The Nominating Committee
will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. Stockholders may
submit a recommendation to the Nominating Committee for consideration with
respect to the 1999
 
                                       2
<PAGE>
Annual Meeting of Stockholders by writing to the Secretary, AAR CORP., One AAR
Place, 1100 N. Wood Dale Road, Wood Dale, Illinois 60191. To be considered,
recommendations must be received prior to May 1, 1999, must state the reasons
for the recommendation and contain the full name and address of each proposed
nominee, as well as a brief biographical history setting forth past and present
directorships, employment and occupations, and any other qualifications.
Recommendations must also include a statement indicating that the proposed
nominees have consented to being named in the proxy statement and to serve if
elected. The Nominating Committee held one meeting during Fiscal 1998.
 
DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION
 
Each director who is not an officer or employee of the Company or any subsidiary
("Eligible Director") receives an annual retainer of $28,000 payable only in
Common Stock of the Company, a fee of $1,750 for attendance at each meeting of
the Board or of any Board committee and reimbursement of expenses. The chairman
of each committee receives an additional $2,000 annual retainer. Each director
may elect to defer receipt of the annual retainer and meeting fees pursuant to
the Company's Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan.
 
In addition, each Eligible Director receives term life insurance coverage of
$200,000 and a one-time grant of stock options for 10,000 shares of Company
Common Stock under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan. These options vest in 25%
increments on each anniversary grant date and can be exercised at the closing
New York Stock Exchange price on the date of grant.
 
Each Eligible Director also will receive benefits under the AAR CORP. Directors'
Retirement Plan upon retirement from the Board on or after age 65 if such
director has completed at least five years of service as a director. Benefits
are paid quarterly in cash in an amount equal to 25% of the annual retainer
payable to an active eligible director and continues for a period equal to the
total number of years of service as a director to a maximum of ten years or
until death. The AAR CORP. Directors' Retirement Plan is unfunded. As of May 31,
1998, one former director was receiving retirement benefits under such Plan.
 
Directors who are officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary receive
no additional compensation for service on the Board or any of its committees.
 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
 
Mr. Jannotta, a director of the Company, is a Senior Director of William Blair &
Company, L.L.C., an investment banking firm ("William Blair"). William Blair,
from time to time, has rendered investment banking services to the Company and
received customary compensation for those services. During Fiscal 1998, William
Blair served as co-manager of a public debt offering on December 15, 1997. The
Company indemnified William Blair against certain liabilities and compensated
William Blair for its services under an underwriting agreement which management
believes was on terms as favorable to the Company as if made with a
non-affiliated party. The Company may engage William Blair for additional
services in the future.

                  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
GENERAL
 
The Company's executive compensation program is structured and administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Committee is comprised
of the five individuals listed at the end of this report, all of whom are
independent directors of the Company.
 
The executive compensation program is designed to enable the Company to attract,
motivate and retain talented executives capable of achieving strategic business
initiatives and to reward them for their achievement. It is designed to
complement the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives and to
focus executives' efforts on fulfilling these objectives. The program consists
of three elements: (i) base salaries which are generally set at approximately
the median salary level of comparable positions in similar companies, adjusted
up or down to reflect individual capabilities and responsibilities and
experience levels and other relevant factors; (ii) annual variable incentive
opportunities paid in cash and stock based on individual contribution and
performance; and (iii) long-term incentive opportunities, in the form of stock
option/restricted stock awards.

<PAGE>
Total compensation opportunities for each executive are intended to be
competitive with those offered by other companies competing for talent in the
Company's employment market. In designing and administering the individual
elements of the executive compensation program for each executive, the Committee
strives to balance short- and long-term incentive objectives and employ prudent
judgment in establishing base salary levels and performance criteria, evaluating
performance and determining actual incentive payments. To ensure competitiveness
and reasonableness of the Committee's compensation decisions, independent
compensation consulting firms are retained periodically to advise the Committee
in connection with both the design and implementation of the various elements of
the program and the level of individual executive participation. Competitive
compensation analyses by independent consultants are used by the Committee to
ensure that the Chief Executive Officer's and Chairman's base salaries and total
compensation are at an appropriate competitive level relative to compensation
for such positions at other companies in the relevant employment market.
Generally, as an executive's level of responsibility increases, a greater
percentage of total compensation is based on performance, and the mix of total
compensation shifts toward stock, thereby aligning the long-term interest of
senior executives with those of stockholders. To encourage stock ownership in
the Company by senior executives, the Company has established guidelines for
ownership of Common Stock by senior management equal in value to 75% of salary,
to be voluntarily achieved over the next several years. An executive's progress
towards achieving these guidelines will be one factor considered by the
Committee in making incentive stock compensation decisions for the executive in
the future.
 
BASE SALARIES
 
Base salary levels of all elected corporate officers, including the Chief
Executive Officer, are reviewed annually by the Committee and may be adjusted
depending upon the executive's qualifications, responsibilities, assessed
performance contribution, tenure in the Company and in the position held, and
competitive salary considerations relative to similar positions at selected
companies in the employment market from which the Company draws its executives.
Adjustments in Fiscal 1998 to the base salaries of the executive officers named
in the Summary Compensation Table, including Mr. Storch, reflect the factors
referred to above.
 
ANNUAL INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES
 
Mr. Storch, President and Chief Executive Officer, has an annual
performance-based incentive bonus opportunity of up to 150% of his base salary.
Twenty percent of Mr. Storch's incentive bonus is payable in three-year
restricted stock. The percentage incentive bonus opportunity for other executive
positions varies depending on their responsibility level and 10% of any bonus
paid is payable in restricted stock.
 
The Compensation Committee establishes specific annual cash bonus performance
goals, intended to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code, each fiscal year for the President and Chief Executive Officer,
the Chairman of the Board, and certain other executive officers of the Company
(as appropriate in the Compensation Committee's discretion). These goals focus
on two categories: income and balance sheet management. The importance and
weighting of these two categories is established each year by the Compensation
Committee. Under the category of balance sheet management, the goals include one
or several of the following criteria: shareholder equity, long-term debt to
capital ratio, investment rating, debt coverage, cash flow or return on invested
capital. Under the category of income, the goals include one or several of the
following: pre-tax income, earnings per share, net income. A participant may
earn up to 100% of such participant's salary (not to exceed $4 million in any
year) for meeting target goals and up to an additional 50% of salary for
exceeding target goals. The amount actually earned depends on each participant's
position and actual performance versus the pre-established goals.
 
                                       8
<PAGE>
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES
 
The long-term incentive program consists of stock option and/or restricted stock
awards granted under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan approved by stockholders
in 1992; Mr. Storch is also eligible for a performance restricted share award
based on performance over a four-year period pursuant to the terms of his
Employment Agreement.
 
Stock option awards typically expire 10 years from the date of grant or earlier
upon termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on
successive grant anniversary dates at the NYSE closing stock price on the date
of grant, and are accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals,
stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company.
Restrictions imposed on restricted stock awards vary and are designed, among
other things, to encourage executives to stay with the Company and to maintain a
focus on long-term objectives of the Company. Typically, restricted stock grants
vest over five (5) years (20% each anniversary), over seven (7) years (25% on
fourth anniversary, 25% on sixth anniversary and 50% on seventh anniversary), or
over 10 years (30% on fourth anniversary, 30% on 7th anniversary and 40% on 10th
anniversary); restrictions on restricted stock used in lieu of cash to pay
earned bonuses are released over three (3) years (33 1/3% on each anniversary).
Typically, awards (other than awards in lieu of cash to pay earned bonuses) are
subject to forfeiture if employment terminates for any reason during the award
cycle. During the award cycle the participant receives dividends on the
restricted shares and also has the right to vote the awarded shares.
 
In determining stock option and restricted stock awards, the Committee considers
the recipient's position and responsibilities in the Company, performance and
contributions made during the preceding year, capabilities and potential for
future contribution to the Company, the number of options and awards previously
granted to the recipient and, for senior management, their progress toward
achieving the Company's guidelines for stock ownership by senior management.
 
The Board believes that the Chief Executive Officer should have the opportunity,
based on performance, to become a significant shareholder and that the
performance measures that govern Mr. Storch's opportunities should be both
economic and shareholder value related. Such measures should also be related to
the Company's industry and investor communities and reflect business objectives
of the Company over the coming years. Mr. Storch has the opportunity, under his
Employment Agreement, to earn up to 540,000 shares at the completion of four
years service as CEO (July 9, 2000) contingent upon the Company's performance
compared to the performance of (i) the Company's peer group index and (ii) the
S&P500 index for both return on total capital and total return to shareholders.
The Board may also make discretionary awards of restricted stock and options
each year based on annual performance. No discretionary long-term incentive
awards were made during Fiscal 1998.
 
Mr. Storch, and other named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table
below received the long-term incentive stock options and restricted stock awards
reflected in the tables below. The number of shares covered by each grant
reflects individual contributions and performance, as well as competitive
industry practices, in the view of the Committee. The grant levels also continue
the Board's emphasis on executive share ownership and further the Company's
objectives of tying incentive compensation to performance and aligning
executive's interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders.
 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
 
The Committee's action with respect to Mr. Storch's total Fiscal 1998
compensation reflects consideration of the factors discussed earlier, and the
leadership role played in the performance results of the Company overall, and in
maintaining the financial strength and liquidity of the Company, contributing to
a 29.5% or $166.7 million increase in shareholder value during the year.
 
                                       9
<PAGE>
Mr. Storch's annual base salary was increased to $610,000 in 1998. Mr. Storch's
salary has steadily increased while serving as President and Chief Executive
Officer and previously as Chief Operating Officer, and in other capacities
during his previous 19 years with the Company.
 
Mr. Storch was awarded an annual incentive bonus in 1998 equal to 136% of his
base salary in effect as of May 31, 1998, reflecting achievement of (i) a net
income growth of 54.9%, (ii) a long-term debt to capital ratio of 37.1%, and
(iii) maintenance of an investment grade credit rating, as well as other
factors, including a substantial improvement over the prior year in consolidated
net sales (up 32.7%).
 
The tables which follow this report and accompanying footnotes and narrative
reflect the decisions covered by the above discussion.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
generally prevents any public company from claiming a deduction for compensation
in excess of $1 million for any executive. This deduction limitation, however,
does not apply to performance-based compensation that satisfies certain
requirements under Section 162(m). The Committee has determined that it is in
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to structure compensation
of executive officers so that compensation will not be subject to the deduction
limit to the extent that it can reasonably do so in a manner that provides
adequate incentives and allows the Company to attract and retain qualified
executives. However, the Committee has and may in the future structure
compensation arrangements that under certain circumstances may be subject to the
deduction limit.

STOCKHOLDER TOTAL RETURN PERFORMANCE GRAPH
 
The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total stockholder return
(including reinvestment of dividends) of the Company, the S&P (Standard &
Poor's) Composite--500 Stock Index, and a peer group index selected by the
Company.
 
The S&P Composite--500 Stock Index is composed of domestic industry leaders in
four major sectors: Industrials, Financials, Utilities and Transportation, and
serves as a broad indicator of the performance of the U.S. equity market. The
peer group index selected by the Company is comprised of companies engaged in
engine, airframe and/or manufacturing activities in support of the
aviation/aerospace aftermarket similar to those conducted by the Company. The
peer group selected by the Company is comprised of the following companies(1):
Aviall, Inc., Aviation Sales Company, Banner Aerospace, Inc., B.F. Goodrich
Company, Kellstrom Industries, Inc., Sequa Corp., SPS Technologies Inc., Willis
Lease Finance Corp., and Wyman Gordan Co.
 
These indices relate only to stock prices and dividends; they do not purport to
provide a direct comparison of the business or financial performance of the
companies comprising such indices with the Company or with each other.

STOCK OPTIONS
 
Options generally become exercisable 20% each year over a five-year period.
Unexercised options expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock option
exercise price is equal to the fair market value (NYSE closing price) of a share
of stock on the date of grant. The options have no value unless the stock price
appreciates and the holder satisfies the applicable vesting requirements.
 
The following table shows certain information with respect to stock options
granted in Fiscal 1998 to the named executive officers. It also shows how much
the named executive officers potentially may realize under two hypothetical
situations: if the stock gains 5% or 10% in value per year
 
                                       12
<PAGE>
compounded over the ten year life of the options. These are assumed hypothetical
rates of appreciation required to be shown by Securities Exchange Commission
regulations as an example and are not a forecast of future stock price
appreciation. Also included in this table by way of example is the hypothetical
increase in value to all stockholders and to all employee optionees under such
circumstances.

    shares then owned by the option holder in payment of the exercise price of
    the initial option. The reload option is for the number of shares
    surrendered and expires concurrent with the original option. The reload
    option exercise price is equal to the fair market value of the underlying
    stock on the date the original option is exercised. Reload options are
    included in the percentage of total options granted to employees shown on
    the chart. Values shown in the Potential Realizable Value columns are

PENSION BENEFITS
 
QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS
 
The Company provides benefits to all domestic employees including the named
executive officers under a qualified retirement program that includes defined
benefits and 401(k)/profit sharing. The defined benefits are determined pursuant
to a formula which takes into consideration years of credited service (to a
maximum of twenty), a percentage of the participant's final average compensation
(the five highest consecutive calendar years of compensation out of the
employee's last ten calendar years of employment) and adjustments for social
security "covered compensation" which is an "offset." Compensation includes cash
compensation shown as income on an employee's Form W-2, reduced by certain items
specified in the Plan, plus amounts contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan.
Compensation for purposes of the Plan cannot exceed an annual compensation
limitation of $160,000 as adjusted from time to time by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue in accordance with applicable provisions of the Code.
 
The aggregate salary and bonus compensation shown for the named executive
officers in the Summary Compensation Table above is the compensation currently
included for purposes of determining benefits under qualified plans as well as
the Supplemental Key Employee Retirement Benefit Plan ("SKERP") described below.
The number of years of credited service under the qualified plans, is as
follows: Mr. Eichner, 20 years; Mr. Storch, 20 years; Mr. Pulsifer, 11 years;
Mr. Romenesko, 17 years; and Mr. Slapke, 14 years. Benefits under the Plan may
be limited by applicable laws or regulations. Profit sharing and 401(k) benefits
are based on voluntary contributions by employees with a 1% match and a
discretionary profit sharing contribution by the Company. The Company's
discretionary profit sharing contribution has typically been in the three to
four percent range.
 
NON-QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS
 
The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain executives and
key employees under the SKERP. All of the named executive officers are
participants in the SKERP, except that Mr. Eichner's participation does not
include supplemental defined benefits. The SKERP is designed to restore the
approximate amount of employer-provided benefits under the Company's qualified
retirement plan lost as a result of Code limitations, including those limiting
compensation for purposes of benefit calculations. Lost benefits restored under
the SKERP are determined in the same manner, using the same compensation data
and years of credited service, as benefits are determined under the Company's
qualified retirement program, subject to maximum compensation limits established
by the Company from time to time (presently $360,000 for key employee
participants and $535,000 for executive officer participants designated by the
Board). The SKERP also provides for aggregate retirement benefits at fifty
percent (50%) of final average compensation (as defined in Plan documents) for
certain executive officers designated by the Board (including three of the named
executive officers), subject to maximum compensation limits established by the
Company from time to time and reduced by certain items specified in Plan
documents. SKERP benefits are unfunded and are forfeited if the participant
violates a covenant not to compete set forth in the Plan document or if
employment is terminated for cause.
 
Mr. Eichner is also covered by an individual Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan ("SERP"). Annual benefits under the SERP are equal to 80% of the aggregate
average of annual salary, bonus and long-term incentive cash payments ("cash
compensation") paid for the three fiscal years in which cash compensation is
highest during any ten fiscal years preceding the date of termination of active
employment, subject to an offset for benefits received under the qualified
defined benefit plan and certain other reductions. Based on Mr. Eichner's cash
compensation history to date, it is estimated that he would receive an annual
after tax retirement benefit of $560,000 under the SERP upon retirement at age
68. The Company funds the benefits through an irrevocable trust arrangement with
a bank. The level of funding is based on actuarial computations determined by an
 
                                       15

independent actuary. The residual in the trust upon Mr. Eichner's death will be
paid to his estate or designated beneficiaries.
 
The following table shows a straight life annuity pension benefit (based on 30%
of an employee's final average compensation) payable annually under the AAR
CORP. Retirement Plan and Supplemental Key Employee Retirement Plan ("SKERP")
commencing at age 65 at various combinations of average compensation and years
of service.
