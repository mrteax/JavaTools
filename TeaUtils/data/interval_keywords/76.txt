The  Board  of  Directors of ACCEL International Corporation (the  "Company"),
a  Delaware  corporation   is  soliciting  proxies,   the  form  of  which  is
enclosed, for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on June  11, 1996.
The cost  of  such  solicitation  will  be borne  by  the  Company.  Officers,
directors  and  regular   employees  of  the  Company  may   communicate  with
stockholders personally or by  mail, telephone, telegram or otherwise  for the
purpose of soliciting  such proxies, but  the Company will  pay no  additional
compensation  for such solicitation. The  Company and any  authorized agent of
the  Company   will  request  brokers  and  other   custodians,  nominees  and
fiduciaries to forward proxy  soliciting material to the beneficial  owners of
shares  held  of record  by  such persons  and will  reimburse  the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in  forwarding such material.  This Proxy Statement  is
being mailed on or about May 21, 1996.

Any  stockholder giving a proxy has the power  to revoke it at any time before
it is voted by a later appointment received by the Secretary of the Company or
by giving notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Company in writing
or in  open meeting. All duly  executed proxies received prior  to the meeting
and not  revoked will  be voted  at the meeting.  The enclosed  proxy contains
space  in which  the stockholder  may insert  instructions as  to the  way the
stockholder  wishes his  shares  to  be voted.  When  such  proxy is  properly
executed and returned,  the shares it represents will be  voted at the meeting
as directed.  If no specification is indicated, the shares will be voted "For"
the election  as directors  of the nominees  listed below  under "Election  of
Directors".

April 12,  1996 has been  fixed as  the record date  for the  determination of
stockholders entitled to such  notice of and to vote at  the Annual Meeting or
any adjournments thereof. On that date the total number of  outstanding shares
of the Company entitled  to vote at the meeting was 4,456,432 shares of Common
Stock, $.10 par value, (the "Common Stock"). The holder  of each share of such
stock is  entitled to one vote.  Pursuant to applicable law,  broker non-votes
and abstentions will not be counted in favor of or against the election of any
nominee  for director  or any of  the other  proposals to be  presented at the
meeting. Any stockholder who abstains from voting on any such proposal will in
effect be voting against it.

                           1.  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
In accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, the number of directors has been
fixed  at ten  by action  of  the Board  of Directors.  Directors are  elected
annually to  serve until the  next Annual Meeting  of Stockholders, and  until
their  successors  are elected  and qualified.  The  election of  directors is
decided by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the
election. In  the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention
of the persons  named in  the proxy to  vote the proxies  for the election  as
directors of the persons nominated below. Although the Board of Directors  has
no reason to believe that any of the nominees set forth below will  not serve,
in the event  that vacancies occur, the proxies will be voted for the election
of such nominees, if any, as shall  be designated by the Board of Directors or
a duly authorized committee thereof.

Section 16(a)  of the  Securities Exchange  Act of  1934 (the  "Exchange Act")
requires the Company's officers  and directors, and persons who own  more than
10% of the Common Stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership
with the Securities  and Exchange Commission (the  "SEC"). Officers, directors
and greater than 10% stockholders  are required by SEC regulations  to furnish
the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based  solely on  its review  of the copies  of such  forms received  by it or
written  representations from certain reporting  persons that no  Forms 5 were
required of  them, the  Company  believes that  during the  fiscal year  ended
December  31,  1995,  all  filing  requirements  applicable to  its  officers,
directors  and greater than 10%  stockholders were complied  with, except that
two  reports covering  an initial  statement of  beneficial ownership  and one
transaction were filed late by Mr. Coats.

                            THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS;

                      COMMITTEES, MEETINGS AND FUNCTIONS
The Board  of Directors  of the Company  met eight  (8) times during  1995. No
director attended  fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of directors
and  of any  committees  on  which  he  served. The  Board  of  Directors  has
established an  Executive Committee,  an Audit  Committee  and a  Compensation
Committee. It does not have a Nominating Committee.

The Executive Committee, which exercises the powers  of the Board of Directors
between  regular  meetings  of  the  Board,  did  not  meet during  1995.  The
membership of the  Executive Committee consists  of Messrs. Friedberg,  Chase,
Deck, Hicks  and Qua.  The Audit  Committee met  one (1)  time during 1995  to
review the results of the  audit of the Company's 1994 financial statements by
the  independent  auditors,  review the  scope  of  the  1995 audit,  consider
relevant matters  pertaining to  internal controls and  accounting procedures,
perform  other  customary  functions  of  Audit  Committees,  and  to  make  a
recommendation  to the  Board of  Directors on  the engagement  of independent
auditors for fiscal  year 1995. The membership of the Audit Committee consists
of Messrs. Qua, Deck and Hicks.

The Compensation  Committee met one  (1) time during  1995 for the  purpose of
reviewing employee  compensation and  benefit arrangements. The  membership of
the Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Deck, Hicks and Qua. The Report
of the Compensation Committee is contained below.


COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 

During 1995, non-employee directors of the  Company continued to abide by  the
one-third reduction in compensation levels  initiated in 1993, and accordingly
received  an annual retainer  of $5,000  plus a  fee of  $500 per  meeting for
attending  any regular  or  special meetings  of the  Board of  Directors. The
members of  each committee of the  Board of Directors, other  than officers of
the  Company, received a  fee of $500  for each meeting  attended. Chairmen of
committees received a fee of $750 for each meeting attended.

The  First Restatement of ACCEL International Corporation 1987 Stock Incentive
Plan (the  "Restated Plan") provides for  options to be granted  every year to
non-employee  directors of the Company for a predetermined number of shares of
Common  Stock.  In   1991,  the  year  the  Restated  Plan  was  adopted,  the
non-employee  directors  were  granted  options  for  2,000  shares  each.  In
subsequent years, options for 1,000 shares each were granted and will continue
to  automatically  be  granted according  to  the  Restated  Plan (subject  to
adjustment  for stock dividends, stock splits and other similar events). Newly
appointed or  elected non-employee  directors are  granted  options for  2,000
shares in  the year they are appointed or elected, and thereafter will receive
the automatic grants. The exercise price is  equal to the fair market value of
a share of stock on the date the option is granted. Options become exercisable
as to 50% of  the shares subject to the option on completion of each full year
prior  to termination of the director's status  as director after the date the
option was  granted. The options  lapse on the  earliest of the  date 10 years
after  the option was granted,  or the date 180  days after the termination of
the director's status  as director. The  options shall  fully vest and  become
completely exercisable upon the death or voluntary retirement of a director.


COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

Executive Compensation including the  grant of stock options is  determined by
the Compensation  Committee of the Board  of Directors. The formal  report  of
the Compensation Committee with respect to 1995 compensation is as follows: 

                      REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Company's compensation package for its executive officers consists of base
salary,  participation in  a  profit sharing  plan  for senior  officers,  and
periodic stock option grants or awards. The base salary for Mr. Friedberg, the
Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, is  fixed by the
Committee  and may  be adjusted  as determined  periodically by  the Committee
after a performance review is  conducted. Since Mr. Friedberg agreed to  serve
without salary  for the current year,  the Committee was not  required to make
any determination  with respect to a  salary or bonus. Base  salary levels for
all other executive officers  are determined by Mr. Friedberg  and recommended
to the Committee.  The amount of profit sharing compensation  and stock option
grants or awards, if any, are also determined by this Committee.

The Committee believes that a significant or meaningful portion of total  cash
compensation should be related  to profitability and the achievement  of fixed
objectives.  Consequently,  the profit  sharing  potential  for the  Company's
executive   officers  is   conditioned   on  overall   corporate   performance
(profitability), and achieving individual  and departmental objectives tied to
a percentage of total base salary.

Generally speaking, base  salary levels are set  and adjusted at  levels which
are part of the Company's budgetary process, yet are believed by the Committee
to  be sufficient to attract  and retain qualified  executives when considered
with the other components of the Company's compensation structure.

Profit sharing plans  were adopted for  all employees of  the Company and  for
senior  officers.  The  overall  objectives  for  establishing  the  Company's
incentive compensation  programs in  1995 were  to enhance  total compensation
without adding fixed  expense, modify  the corporate reward  systems and  give
managers  the discretion  to  reward contributors,  better focus  management's
attention on the  achievement of  objectives and drive  accountability to  all
levels of the Company, and foster teamwork.

For 1995,  the  profit sharing  goal  set for  all  employees and  the  senior
officers was the attainment of a predetermined level of profit by the Company.
Accordingly,  no  profit sharing  compensation was  paid  to any  employees or
senior  officers in  1995. Furthermore, the  freeze on base  salaries put into
effect during 1993 for all senior officers of the Company and its subsidiaries
was continued into 1995.


In  addition to  approving the  ACCEL Bonus  Plan, the  Compensation Committee
determines  annual stock  option grants  or awards  to executive  officers and
other  eligible  employees.  Stock  options  are  intended  to  encourage  key
employees to remain employed by the Company by providing them with a long-term
interest  in the Company's overall performance as reflected by the performance
of the market of the Company's Common Stock.

additional month.  On December 13,  1993, the Board of  Directors notified Mr.
Williamson that the employment  agreement would be terminated on  February 28,
1997. Mr.  Williamson's base salary under the agreement was $225,000 per year.
In addition  to a  base salary, the  agreement provided for  a cash  bonus and

          2.  PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

TO INCREASE TOTAL AUTHORIZED SHARES

In the  judgment  of the  Board of  Directors  of the  Company, it  is  deemed
advisable to increase  the total number  of authorized shares of  Common Stock
from  10,000,000 to 15,000,000 by amending the Certificate of Incorporation so
that the first sentence of Article Fourth will read as follows:

      FOURTH:  The  Corporation shall be  authorized to  issue two classes  of
      shares of stock  to be designated,  respectively, "Preferred Stock"  and
      "Common Stock"; the total  number of shares which the  Corporation shall
      have authority  to  issue is  sixteen  million (16,000,000);  the  total
      number of shares of Preferred Stock shall be one million (1,000,000) and
      each such share  shall have a par value  of one dollar ($1.00);  and the
      total  number of  shares  of  Common  Stock  shall  be  fifteen  million
      (15,000,000) and each  such share shall  have a par  value of ten  cents
      ($.10).

The Company's  Certificate of Incorporation currently  authorizes the issuance
of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock and  1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.
As of  April  12, 1996,  4,456,432  shares of  Common  Stock were  issued  and
outstanding.

The Board of Directors is  asking the stockholders to approve the  adoption of
the 1996  Stock Incentive Plan  pursuant to  which 1,000,000 shares  of Common
Stock will be available for issuance.  In addition, the Board of Directors has
authorized  a rights offering ("Rights Offering") in which each stockholder of
record  on a  date yet  to be  determined would  receive rights  ("Rights") to
subscribe  for additional  shares of  the Company's  Common Stock.  Holders of
Rights would also be  entitled to an oversubscription privilege.  Although the
number  of shares  which  may  be  offered  in the  Rights  Offering  and  the
subscription  price have not been  finally determined, the  Board of Directors
has  authorized  the  issuance of  up  to 7,000,000  shares  of  Common Stock.
Accordingly, it  is possible  that a  significant number of  shares of  Common
Stock could  be issued in  the Rights Offering.  The Rights Offering  would be
subject to  the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the
Securities and  Exchange Commission  and  would be  made only  by  means of  a
prospectus. Other than  the adoption of the 1996 Stock  Incentive Plan and the
proposed Rights  Offering, no  specific transaction is  presently contemplated
which would result in the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock.

The Board of Directors believes  it to be in the best interest  of the Company
and its  stockholders to increase  the number of  authorized shares  of Common
Stock which  would be readily  available without further  stockholder approval
for  such  activities  as  possible acquisitions,  future  financing,  use  in
connection with possible stock dividends or  possible diversification into new
insurance  programs  through  the  issuance  of  stock  or  stock  options  to
independent agents and for any other corporate purposes.


The additional shares  of Common  Stock authorized by  the proposed  amendment
will, if and when issued, have the same rights and privileges as the shares of
Common Stock currently authorized and outstanding. Holders of shares of Common
Stock of the Company have no pre-emptive rights. If the  proposed amendment is
adopted, additional shares of  Common Stock could be issued in  the discretion
of the Board of Directors of the Company without further stockholder approval.

The  Certificate of  Incorporation  contains a  provision  which requires  the
affirmative  vote of not less than 80 percent of the outstanding shares of the
Company  entitled  to elect  directors for  the  approval of  certain business
combinations and  other  transactions  with  a corporation  or  any  affiliate
thereof which  acquires more than five percent  of the beneficial ownership of
the outstanding  shares of Common  Stock of the  Company unless such  business
combination or other  transaction was approved by  resolution of the  Board of
Directors  of the  Company prior  to the  acquisition by  such corporation  or
affiliate thereof of the beneficial ownership of more than five percent of the
outstanding  Common Stock. This provision  could have the  effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock of the Company is required to authorize the proposed amendment to
the Certificate of Incorporation.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT.

         3.  APPROVAL OF THE ADOPTION OF THE 1996 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

1996 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

Subject to  stockholder approval, on March 11, 1996, the Board of Directors of
the Company adopted the Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").  The
Plan, if  approved by the Stockholders,  will become effective June  11, 1996.
The  purpose of the Plan is to  advance the long-term interests of the Company
by (i) motivating executive,  other personnel and independent agents  by means
of long-term incentive compensation; (ii) furthering the identity of interests
of  participants with  those of  the stockholders  of the Company  through the
ownership  and performance  of  the Common  Stock of  the  Company; and  (iii)
permitting the Company to attract and retain directors and executive personnel
upon whose  judgment the successful  conduct of  the business  of the  Company
largely depends.

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect  to which awards may
be granted under the  Plan is 1,000,000  and the maximum  number of shares  of
Common Stock that may  be awarded during any calendar year  may not exceed 10%
of the total  number of issued and outstanding  shares of Common Stock  of the
Company.  The Common Stock to be issued by  the Company under the Plan will be
made available  from authorized  but unissued shares  of Common Stock  or from
treasury  shares.   The  Plan contains  customary  provisions with  respect to
adjustments  for share  splits  and similar  transactions  and the  rights  of
participants  upon mergers and other business combinations.  The Plan provides
for stock option, stock appreciation  rights, restricted stock, phantom  stock
and performance awards.  No award under the Plan may be granted after June 11,
2006.  The  Plan may  be amended or  terminated at  any time by  the Board  of
Directors acting  through a Committee,  except that  no amendment may  be made
without stockholder approval if the Committee determines that such approval is
necessary  to comply  with any  tax or  regulatory requirement,  including any
approval requirement which is a prerequisite for exemptive relief from Section
16 of the Exchange Act, for which or with which the Committee  determines that
it is desirable to qualify or comply.

SUMMARY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN

The  following summary of the Plan is qualified  in its entirety by the actual
provisions of the Plan included in this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A.

Overview.  The Plan permits the granting of (1) options to purchase shares  of
Common Stock which are either (a)  non-statutory stock options ("Non-statutory
Stock  Options") not intended to  qualify for special  tax treatment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended (the "Code"), or (b)  options which
are intended to qualify as incentive  stock options under the Code ("Incentive
Stock  Options"), (2)  stock  appreciation rights  in  conjunction with  stock
options,  (3)  restricted  stock awards,  (4)  phantom  stock  awards and  (5)
performance  shares.  All  employees of the  Company and its  subsidiaries who
hold a  position of responsibility in an executive, managerial, administrative
or professional capacity or  independent agents who market and  sell insurance
written by a  subsidiary of the Company, and whose  performance, as determined
by the Committee (as defined below under the  caption "Administration") in the
exercise of  the Committee's sole and absolute  discretion, can have an effect
on the  growth, profitability and success  of the Company, are  eligible to be
participants in  the Plan.   In addition, the  Plan provides for  the grant of
stock options to Directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries (the "Outside Directors").  The Plan is not subject
to the provisions  of the Employee Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974, as
amended, and is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

Common Stock Available.  The total  number of shares of Common Stock available
under the Plan is 1,000,000 shares.  Of this number, up to 100,000  shares may
be  issued pursuant  to  the exercise  of  Outside Directors'  stock  options.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at no time shall the number of shares of Common
Stock deemed  available for grant in any  fiscal year exceed 10%  of the total
number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.  The number of shares
of  Common Stock  available for  grant to  any individual  participant in  any
calendar year shall not exceed 250,000.  The number of shares of Common  Stock
which remain available for grant pursuant to the Plan and Common Stock subject
to outstanding  awards will be  appropriately and proportionately  adjusted to
reflect changes in the Company's capitalization, including stock splits, stock
dividends,  mergers,  reorganizations,  consolidations and  recapitalizations.
The   purchase  price  per  share  under  outstanding  options  will  also  be
appropriately adjusted to reflect capitalization changes.

Administration.  The Plan may be administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board  of Directors or  such other  committee designated by  the Board  to
administer the  Plan under  Section  3 of  the Plan  (the  "Committee").   The
Committee shall be composed of at least three directors and shall serve at the
pleasure  of the Board of Directors.   Each member of the  Committee must be a
director who is  a "disinterested person" under Rule  16b-3 under the Exchange
Act  and an  "outside  director" under  Section  162(m) of  the  Code and  the
regulations  thereunder.    The Committee  has  the  authority  to select  the
employees  and/or independent agents to be participants, to determine the type
and number of awards to be granted, and to establish rules and regulations for
the administration of the Plan.

Stock Options.  For stock options  granted to employees or independent  agents
under the Plan, the option price per share  will be not less than 100% of  the
fair market value of  Common Stock on the date  of the grant.  Payment  of the
option price upon  exercise of an option may be made in cash, Common Stock, or
a combination thereof, as set forth in the option agreement.  The term of each
option  will be  fixed by the  Committee, except that  Incentive Stock Options
will  not be exercisable after ten  years from the grant date.   The grant and
terms of Incentive Stock Options will be limited to the extent required by the
Code.  Independent agents shall not be eligible to receive grants of Incentive
Stock Options.   In the absence of any provision in  an option to the contrary
(i) options will  become exercisable as to  25% of the shares  of Common Stock
subject to the option upon the completion of the first full year of employment
or retention and  as to 25%  of such shares upon  the completion of  each full
year  thereafter prior to  termination of the  participant's relationship with
the  Company, and (ii)  options will  lapse upon the  earlier of  (w) 180 days
after  the termination of the  participant's relationship with  the Company if
the termination is  due to due  to death or  disability or if the  participant
dies  within 90  days of such  termination, (x)  90 after  termination  of the
participant's  relationship with the Company  for any other  reason other than
death,  disability  or gross misconduct  or neglect, (y)  upon  termination of
the  participant's relationship  with the  Company if  the termination  is the
result of the participant's  gross misconduct or neglect as  determined by the
Committee, and (z) ten years after the option  was granted.  Each stock option
will  be evidenced by an option agreement  conforming to the provisions of the
Plan,  in such form as  is approved by  the Committee from time  to time.  The
option agreement will set forth the number of shares of Common Stock  that are
subject to the option, the type of option granted, the option price to be paid
upon exercise, the manner in which  the option is to be exercised,  the option
period, and such other terms as may be approved by the Committee.

Stock  Appreciation Rights.  Stock appreciation rights may be granted pursuant
to the  Plan either separately  or in  conjunction with other  awards.   Stock
appreciation rights related to stock options may be granted when the option is
granted, and with respect to non-statutory options, also may be granted at any
time  before exercise or expiration  of the option.   Upon exercise of a stock
appreciation right, the  holder will receive  payment from  the Company in  an
amount  equal to the excess of the then  fair market value of the Common Stock
covered by the stock appreciation right over  the option or grant price of the
stock  appreciation  right.   The  Committee  may  impose  such conditions  or
restrictions  on the  exercise  of  any  stock  appreciation  right  it  deems
appropriate.

Restricted Stock  Awards.  Restricted stock awards  may be granted pursuant to
the  Plan.  Shares of Common Stock covered  by restricted stock awards may not
be sold  or otherwise  transferred by the  recipient until termination  of the
restrictions applicable  to the awards, which restrictions will be established
by  the Committee and  need not be the  same for all  such awards.  Restricted
stock  awards shall  be subject  to such  terms, conditions,  restrictions, or
limitations as the Committee  deems appropriate.   During the period in  which
any shares  of Common Stock are subject to restrictions, the Committee may, in
its  discretion, grant to recipients all or  any of the rights of stockholders
with respect to such Common Stock.

Phantom Stock Awards.  Awards of  phantom stock may be granted under  the Plan
either separately or in  conjunction with other awards.   Phantom stock awards
entitle the  recipient to receive the market value or appreciation in value of
a  stated number of shares of Common Stock  on a settlement date determined by
the Committee.  The  Committee has complete authority to determine  the terms,
conditions, restrictions and limitations of such awards.

Performance  Shares.    Performance shares  may  be  granted  under the  Plan.
Performance shares are convertible into Common Stock or cash, or a combination
thereof, upon the  obtainment of predetermined  performance targets during  an
established performance period.  The Committee shall establish the performance
targets, the performance period and  the other terms, conditions, restrictions
or limitations on any award of performance shares.

Outside Director  Stock Options.  The  Plan provides for the  grant to Outside
Directors  of  options to  purchase  Common  Stock  ("Outside  Director  Stock
Options").   See "Compensation of  Directors".  Each  Outside Director  who is
elected or appointed to serve as a Director of the Company after the effective
date of the Plan and who is not  a Director on the effective date of the Plan,
shall, upon his initial  appointment or election, automatically be  granted an
option  to  purchase 2,000  shares of  Common Stock.    At each  year's annual
meeting of  the  stockholders of  the Company  commencing at  the 1997  annual
meeting there shall be  granted automatically to each Outside  Director (other
than any Outside Director  who first became a Director at  any time during the
period following  the immediately  preceding annual meeting  of stockholders),
the option  to purchase 1,000  shares of Common  Stock.  All  Outside Director
Stock Options will be Non-statutory Stock Options with a 10-year term, and the
purchase price per share will be 100% of the fair market value of Common Stock
on the date of grant.  Payment of the option price may be made in cash, Common
Stock, or a combination thereof, as set forth in the option agreement.  In the
absence of any  provision in an  option to the  contrary, options will  become
exercisable as to 50% of the shares of Common Stock subject to the option upon
the completion of the  first full year after the date thereof and as to 50% of
such  shares upon  the  completion  of  each full  year  thereafter  prior  to
termination.   Outside Director Stock Options not otherwise exercisable at the
time  of  the termination  of  the  Director's status  as  a  Director may  be
exercised for 180 days following the date of such termination, as long as such
period is within the  original 10-year option term.  Outside  Director Options
not otherwise  exercisable at the time of the death or voluntary retirement of
a Director may  be exercised for a period of 180  days subject to the original
term of the option.

Tax  Effects.   For  federal income  tax  purposes, under  existing  statutes,
regulations  and authorities, an optionee  does not realize  taxable income at
the time  of the grant  of an  Incentive Stock Option,  a Non-statutory  Stock
Option, phantom stock award or a stock appreciation right.   Upon the exercise
of a  Non-statutory Stock  Option, the Company  is entitled to  a compensation
expense deduction in the amount  by which the fair market value of the subject
Common  Stock  exceeds the  option price  and  the optionee  realizes ordinary
income in such amount.   Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation  right, the
Company is entitled  to a deduction and the  optionee realizes ordinary income
in the  amount of the cash or fair market  value of the Common Stock received.
On  the subsequent  sale  of Common  Stock  received upon  the  exercise of  a
Non-statutory  Stock Option, the difference  between the fair  market value of
the Common Stock  on the date of receipt  and the amount realized on  the sale
will be  treated as capital  gain or  loss, which will  be short or  long term
depending on the period for which the Common Stock is held  prior to the sale.
An  optionee will  have no taxable  income upon  the exercise  of an Incentive
Stock Option (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply) and generally
does not  realize taxable income until  the sale of the  Common Stock received
upon exercise of the option.  If a sale does not take place until at least two
years after grant  and one year after exercise of the option, any gain or loss
realized will  be treated  as long  term capital  gain  or loss.   Under  such
circumstances,  the Company will not be entitled  to a deduction in connection
with the grant or the  exercise of the option.  If a  disposition occurs prior
to  two years  after grant  or one  year after  exercise, then  the difference
between the option price and the fair market value  of the Common Stock on the
date  of exercise (or in  certain cases, the amount realized  on sale, if less
than the market value  on the date of exercise) is  taxable as ordinary income
to the  optionee and  is  deductible by  the Company  for  federal income  tax
purposes.

With respect to  awards of phantom stock, a  participant will realize ordinary
income equal  to the fair market value of  the Common Stock or appreciation in
value  of the  Common Stock,  as applicable,  on the  settlement date  and the
Company will be entitled to a deduction  in the same amount.  With respect  to
restricted stock  awards, a participant generally will realize ordinary income
equal to  the fair market value of  the Common Stock received  as of the first
day that such shares of Common Stock become transferable or are not subject to
substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier.  The Company will be
entitled to a deduction at that time in the same amount.

Assignment of Interest.  Except as expressly provided in the Plan with respect
to  transfers by  will or  the laws  of descent  and distribution,  no option,
phantom stock awards, stock  appreciation right or restricted stock  award may
be assigned or transferred by any participant.

Limitations  on  Resale  of Securities.    Participants  who  are officers  or
directors of the  Company, including those  who may be deemed  "affiliates" of
the Company,  as such term is  defined under the Securities  Act, have certain
limitations on their ability to resell  Common Stock acquired pursuant to  the
Plan.   Any sale of Common Stock by  an employee or Outside Director also must
be made  in compliance with the Company's policies on trading in securities of
the Company.

Amendment or Termination of the Plan.  No awards may be granted under the Plan
after June  11, 2006.   The  Plan gives  the Committee the  power to  suspend,
reinstate and terminate  the Plan  or any  portion thereof  at any  time.   In
addition, the Committee may amend the Plan, except  that, without any required
stockholder  approval,  no  such amendment  may  (1)  materially increase  the
benefits to participants in the Plan, (2) materially increase the total number
of  shares of Common Stock that  could be issued or  (3) materially modify the
requirements as to eligibility for participation  in the Plan.  The provisions
of the Plan relating to the eligibility  for, and the amount, price and timing
of, awards to Outside Directors may not be amended, nor shall the operation of
such provisions be suspended or reinstated, more than once every six months.

      which shares are held  in portfolios of DFA Investment  Dimensions Group
      Inc., a registered open-end investment company, or  in series of the DFA
      Investment  Trust Company, a Delaware  business trust, or  the DFA Group
      Trust  and  DFA  Participation  Group  Trust,  investment  vehicles  for
      qualified employee benefit plans, all of which Dimensional Fund Advisors
      Inc.  serves  as investment  manager.  Dimensional disclaims  beneficial

(4)   Tweedy,  Browne Company  L.P.  ("TBC"), a  registered broker-dealer  and
      registered  investment advisor,  and  TBK Partners,  L.P. ("TBK"),  have
      jointly filed amendments  to their respective Schedule  13D Reports (the
      "Schedule 13D")  with the SEC. The  Schedule 13D stated that  TBC may be
      deemed  to have  beneficial ownership  of 246,000  shares, all  of which
      shares are  held in accounts  of various customers  of TBC.  TBC further
      reported that it has  investment discretion with respect to  all 246,000
      shares  and  sole  power to  vote  171,000  shares.  As  a result  of  a
      disposition  of shares, TBK reported  that it does  not beneficially own
      any shares. Each  of TBC and TBK disclaimed beneficial  ownership of the
      246,000  shares  held  in the  TBC  accounts  and  disclaimed beneficial
      ownership  of the shares  held by the  other. TBK and  TBC also reported
      that their respective general partners, four of whom are common to each,
      may, solely  by reason of  their positions as  such, be deemed  to share
      voting power and dispositive  power with respect to the  shares. Finally
      TBC and  TBK stated that  the filing of the  Schedule 13D should  not be
      deemed an admission that TBC and TBK comprise a group within the meaning
      of Section 13(d)(3) of the Act.

                 RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT PUBLIC AUDITORS
KPMG Peat Marwick LLP has  served as the independent auditors for  the company
for each  of the years  in the  two-year period  ended December  31, 1995.  In
recent years, it has been  the practice of the Board of Directors  to annually
review and select independent auditors for the Company. The Board of Directors
intends to  continue such  practice and to  make the selection  of independent
auditors later  in the  year. The  selection of  independent auditors  has not
therefore been made for the current fiscal  year. Representatives of KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP will  be  present  at  the Annual  Meeting  of  Stockholders  with
an opportunity to  make a statement  and  will  be  available  to  respond  to
appropriate questions, if any, of the stockholders of the Company.

Directors,  and may resign  by written notice  filed with the  Chairman of the
Board, President or Secretary of the Company.  A  vacancy in the membership of

entered  into  hereunder; (ii)  establish,  amend  and rescind  Administrative

Participants in the Plan,  the Committee shall not knowingly  take any action,
or decline  to take any  action, which  shall cause the  Plan not to  meet the
requirements contained in  Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act,  as such rule is
amended or superseded from time  to time, which permit the granting  or making
of Awards  under the Plan to be exempt from  Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
as amended or superseded from time to time.

Section 4.  Eligibility

      Except as otherwise  provided herein,  any Key Employee  is eligible  to
become a  Participant in  the  Plan.   Directors of  the  Company, other  than
Directors who are employees of the  Company, shall be eligible only to receive
stock options pursuant to Section 13 hereof.

Section 5.  Shares Available

      (a) Shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the  Plan may be
authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.  Subject to the adjustments
provided for in  Sections 17 and  18 hereof, the  maximum number of  shares of
Common Stock available for grant of Awards under the Plan is 1,000,000 shares.
Of  this total  number, up to  100,000 shares  may be  issued pursuant  to the
exercise  of Directors' Stock Options.   Notwithstanding the  foregoing, at no
time shall the  number of shares  of Common Stock deemed  to be available  for
grant in any fiscal year exceed ten percent of the total number of  issued and
outstanding  shares of Common Stock  of the Company.   The number of shares of
Common Stock available for grant to any individual Participant in any calendar
year shall not exceed 250,000 shares.

      (b)  For purposes  of calculating the  number of shares  of Common Stock
deemed to be  granted hereunder  during any fiscal  year, each Award,  whether
denominated  in stock  options, stock  appreciation rights,  restricted stock,
performance shares or phantom stock, shall be deemed to be a grant of a number
of shares  of Common Stock  equal to the number  of shares represented  by the
stock options,  shares  of restricted  stock,  performance shares,  shares  of
phantom stock or  stock appreciation rights set  forth in the  Award; provided
however

           (i)  in the case of any Award as to which the exercise of one right
      nullifies  the   exercisability  of   another  (including,  by   way  of
      illustration   the  grant  of  a  stock  option  with  Tandem  SARs  (as
      hereinafter  defined)), the number of shares deemed to have been granted
      shall be the  maximum number  of shares (and/or  cash equivalents)  that
      could have been acquired upon the maximum exercise  or settlement of the
      Award; and

           (ii)  in  the case  of  Performance  Share Awards  (as  hereinafter
      defined)  providing for  payments in  excess of  100% of  the number  of
      shares set forth  in the Award Agreement,  the number of shares  granted
      shall be  deemed to be  the maximum  number of shares  (and/or the  cash
      equivalent thereof) issuable  under the  Award at the  highest level  of
      performance.

      (c) Shares of Common  Stock covered by lapsed, canceled,  surrendered or
terminated  Awards shall  be  shares available  for  regrant under  the  Plan;
provided, however, that the portion of any Award that has been settled  by the
payment of cash or  the issuance of shares  of Common Stock, or a  combination
thereof, shall not be available for  re-grant under the Plan, irrespective  of
the value of the settlement or the method of its payment. The settlement of an
Award shall not be deemed to be the grant of an Award hereunder.

Section 6.  Term

      The Plan shall become effective as of June 11, 1996, subject to approval
of the Plan  by the holders of a  majority of the shares of Common  Stock.  No
Awards shall  be exercisable or payable  before approval of the  Plan has been
obtained from the  Company's stockholders and  no Awards may be  granted after
June 11, 2006. 

Section 7.  Participation

      The Committee shall select,  from time to time, Participants  from those
Key Employees  who, in the  opinion of the  Committee, can further  the Plan's
purpose and the Committee shall determine the type or types of Awards, if any,
to be made  to the Participant.  Any selection by the Committee of an employee
or independent agent of the Company or a Subsidiary to be a Participant in the
Plan shall  irrevocably constitute  the Committee's concurrent  and conclusive


determination  that such employee or independent agent  is a Key Employee.  In
addition, all non-employee Directors  shall participate in the Plan  solely in
the  manner  specified  in  Section  13 hereof.    The  terms,  conditions and
restrictions of  each Award shall be  set forth in an Award  Agreement, and no
Participant shall have any rights to or  interest in an Award unless and until
such Participant has exercised  and delivered an Award Agreement  with respect
to such Award.

Section 8.  Stock Options

      (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of stock options.  Stock
options may  be incentive stock options  within the meaning of  Section 422 of
the  Code or  nonqualified stock  options (i.e., stock  options which  are not
incentive stock options), or a combination  of both, or any particular type of
tax advantage option authorized by the Code from time to time.


      (b) Terms  and Conditions of Options.  An option shall be exercisable in
whole  or in such installments  and at such times as  may be determined by the
Committee; provided, however, that  no stock option shall be  exercisable more
than ten  years after  the date  of  grant thereof.   In  the absence  of  any
provision in an option to the contrary (i) the option  will become exercisable
upon  as to  25% of  the shares  of Common  Stock subject  to the  option upon
completion  of  the  first  full  year  of  employment  or  retention  of  the
Participant after  the date  thereof and  as to  25% of such  shares upon  the
completion of  each full year  thereafter prior  to Termination, and  (ii) the
option will lapse  upon the earliest of (A) 180 days  after Termination of the
Participant's relationship with the Company if the Termination is due to death
or disability  or if the Participant  dies within 90 days  of the Termination,
(B) 90  days after Termination if the Termination is for any reason other than
death, disability or gross  misconduct or neglect, (C) upon Termination if the
Termination is the result of the  Participant's gross misconduct or neglect as
determined by  the Committee, or (D)  ten years after the  option was granted.
The  option exercise  price shall be  established by  the Committee,  but such
price  shall not be less  than the per  share fair market value  of the Common
Stock, as determined by the Committee, on the date of the stock option's grant
subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 17 or 18 hereof.

      (c) Restrictions  Relating to  Incentive Stock Options.   Stock  options
issued  in the  form of incentive  stock options  shall, in  addition to being
subject to  all applicable terms, conditions,  restrictions and/or limitations
established by  the Committee, comply with Section 422 of the Code.  Incentive
stock  options shall be granted only to  those Key Employees who are employees
of the Company and its "subsidiaries" within the meaning of Section 424 of the
Code, shall  not be  granted  to any  independent agents  unless permitted  by
Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision and shall be granted within
ten years after the date the Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors.   The
aggregate fair  market value (determined as of the date the option is granted)
of shares with  respect to which incentive  stock options are exercisable  for
the  first time by an individual during any  calendar year (under this Plan or
any other  plan  of the  Company  or any  Subsidiary  which provides  for  the
granting  of incentive  stock options) may  not exceed $100,000  or such other
number as may be applicable  under the Code from time to time.   Any incentive
stock option that is granted to any employee who is, at the time the option is
granted,  deemed for  purposes of Section  422 of  the Code,  or any successor
provision, to own shares of the Company possessing more than ten percent (10%)
of the total  combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or
of a  parent or subsidiary of the Company shall  have an option exercise price
that is at least 110 percent (110%) of the fair market value of the  shares at
the date of grant and shall not be exercisable after the expiration of 5 years
from the date it is granted.

      (d) Additional Terms and Conditions.   The Committee may, in  any manner
not inconsistent  with the Plan, by  way of the Award  Agreement or otherwise,
establish  such other terms, conditions, restrictions  and/ or limitations, if
any, on any stock option Award and the exercise thereof.


      (e) Payment.   Upon exercise, a Participant  may pay the option exercise
price of a stock option (i) in cash, (ii) in shares of Common Stock,  or (iii)
a  combination thereof,  or (iv)  in  the sole  discretion  of the  Committee,
through  a cashless exercise procedure  involving a broker; provided, however,
that  such method  and  time for  payment  shall  be permitted  by  and be  in
compliance  with  applicable  law, or  (v)  such  other  consideration as  the
Committee  may deem  appropriate.  The  Committee shall  establish appropriate
methods for accepting Common Stock and  may impose such conditions as it deems
appropriate on the use of such Common Stock to exercise a stock option.

Section 9.  Stock Appreciation Rights

      (a) Grants.   Awards may be  granted in the  form of stock  appreciation
rights ("SARs"). SARs shall entitle the  recipient to receive a payment  equal
to the appreciation  in market value of  a stated number  of shares of  Common
Stock from the price stated in the  Award Agreement to the market value of the
Common Stock on  the date of  exercise or surrender. A  SAR may be  granted in
tandem with all or a portion of a related stock option under the Plan ("Tandem
SARs").  Tandem SARs shall permit the optionee to surrender a stock  option or
portion  thereof and to receive the payment  to which he is entitled under the
SAR Award Agreement with respect to the shares of  Common Stock subject to the
surrendered stock  option  or portion  thereof. A  Tandem SAR  may be  granted
either  at the time of  the grant of  the related stock option  or at any time
thereafter during the term of the stock option.

      (b)  Terms  and Conditions  of  Tandem  SARs.   A  Tandem  SAR shall  be
exercisable to  the extent, and  only to  the extent, that  the related  stock
option is exercisable. The appreciation  in value of a Tandem SAR shall be the
appreciation in  fair market  value from  an amount not  less than  the option
exercise   price  of  the  related  stock  option  or  portion  thereof  being
surrendered to the market  value of the Common Stock on  the date of exercise.
Upon exercise of  a Tandem SAR as to  some or all of the shares  covered by an
Award, the related stock option shall be canceled  automatically to the extent
of  the number  of SARs  exercised, and  such shares  shall not  thereafter be
eligible for grant under Section 5 hereof.

      (c) Deemed Exercise.   The Committee  may provide that  an SAR shall  be
deemed to  be exercised at the  close of business on  the scheduled expiration
date  of such  SAR,  if  at such  time  the  SAR  by its  terms  is  otherwise
exercisable  and,  if  so  exercised,  would  result  in  a  payment  to   the
Participant.

      (d) Additional Terms  and Conditions.  The Committee may,  in any manner
not inconsistent  with the Plan, by  way of the Award  Agreement or otherwise,
determine such  other terms,  conditions, restrictions and/or  limitations, if
any, on any SAR Award.

Section 10.  Restricted Stock Awards

      (a)  Grants.   Awards may  be granted  in the  form of  Restricted Stock
Awards.   Restricted Stock  Awards consist of  shares of Common  Stock bearing
restrictions  on their transfer or  otherwise as authorized  by Section 10(b),
below,  and  may be  awarded to  a  Key Employee  with or  without  payment of
consideration by the Key Employee.

      (b) Award Restrictions.   Restricted  Stock Awards shall  be subject  to
such  terms, conditions, restrictions,  or limitations as  the Committee deems
appropriate including, by  way of illustration but  not by way  of limitation,
restrictions on  transferability,  requirements  of  continued  employment  or
individual  performance  or  the  financial performance  of  the  Company. The
Committee  may  modify, or  accelerate  the termination  of,  the restrictions
applicable to a Restricted  Stock Award under  such circumstances as it  deems
appropriate.

      (c) Rights  as Stockholders.  During  the period in which  any shares of
Common  Stock are subject  to the restrictions imposed  under this Section 10,


the Committee  may, in its discretion,  grant to the Participant  to whom such
restricted shares have been awarded, all or any of the rights of a stockholder
with respect to such shares, including, by way of illustration  but not by way
of limitation, the right to vote such shares and to receive dividends.


      (d)  Evidence of Award.   Any Restricted  Stock Award granted  under the
Plan  may be  evidenced in  such manner  as  the Committee  deems appropriate,
including,  without limitation, book entry registration or issuance of a stock
certificate or certificates.

      (e) Additional  Terms and Conditions.  The  Committee may, in any manner
not  inconsistent with  the  Plan, by  way  of Award  Agreement  or otherwise,
determine such other  terms, conditions, restrictions or  limitations, if any,
on any Award of Restricted Stock.

Section 11.  Phantom Stock

      (a) Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of Phantom  Stock Awards.
Phantom Stock Awards shall entitle the Participant to receive the market value
or the appreciation in value of a stated number of shares of Common Stock on a
settlement date determined by the Committee.

      (b)  Terms  and  Conditions.   The  Committee  may,  in any  manner  not
inconsistent with the  Plan, by way of Award Agreement or otherwise, determine
such terms, conditions,  restrictions or limitations, if any, on  any Award of
Phantom Stock.

Section 12.  Performance Shares

      (a) Grants.   Awards may be  granted in the form  of performance shares.
"Performance  Shares" means interests the  entitlement to which  is based upon
the attainment  of pre-determined  Performance Targets as  hereinafter defined
during  a Performance  Period  as  hereinafter  defined. At  the  end  of  the
Performance Period,  Performance Shares shall  be converted into  Common Stock
(or  Common  Stock and  cash,  as  determined  by  the  Award  Agreement)  and
distributed to Participants based upon such entitlement.

      (b)  Performance  Criteria.    The  Committee  may  grant  an  Award  of
Performance  Shares to Participants  as of the  first day of  each Performance
Period. As  used herein, the term "Performance Period" means the period during
which a Performance Target is measured and the term "Performance Target" means
the  predetermined goals  established by the  Committee. A  Performance Target
will be established at the beginning of each Performance Period. If at the end
of   the  Performance  Period,  the  Performance  Target  is  fully  met,  the
Performance Shares will be converted 100% into shares of Common  Stock (or the
cash equivalent thereof, as determined by  the Award Agreement) and issued  to
the Participant.  Award payments in  excess of  100% shall be  permitted based
upon  an  attainment in  excess  of 100%  of  the Performance  Target.  If the
Performance  Target has  not  been  fully  met,  Performance  Shares  will  be
converted and delivered  only to the extent,  if any, provided at the  time of
the grant  of such Award for  conversion based upon partial  attainment of the
Performance Target and the balance of the Performance Shares will be forfeited
to the Company and available for reissuance pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

      (c) Additional  Terms and Conditions.  The  Committee may, in any manner
not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, by way of the Award Agreement or
otherwise, determine the manner of payment of Awards of Performance Shares and
other terms, conditions, restrictions or limitations,  if any, on any Award of
Performance Shares.

Section 13.  Directors' Stock Options

      (a) Grants.  Awards may be granted to non-employee Directors only in the
form of  stock options satisfying the  requirements of this Section  13.  Each
person who is elected or appointed to serve as a Director of the Company after


the effective date of the Plan and who is not a Director on the effective date
of the  Plan shall, upon  his initial appointment  or election as  a Director,
automatically be granted an option for 2,000 shares of Common  Stock.  At each
year's annual  meeting of the  stockholders of  the Company commencing  at the
1997 annual meeting, there shall be granted automatically to each non-employee
Director (other than any non-employee Director who first became  a Director at
any  time during the period following the immediately preceding annual meeting
of the  stockholders of the Company),  the option to purchase  1,000 shares of
Common  Stock.   All  stock options  granted under  this  Section 13  shall be
nonqualified stock options.

      (b) Option  Exercise Price.    The option  exercise price  of all  stock
options granted under this Section 13 shall be the per share fair market value
of the  outstanding shares of  the Common Stock  on the date  such options are
automatically granted.   Payment of the  option exercise price may  be made in
cash or in shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock to
the extent provided in the Award Agreement.

      (c) Administration.  Subject  to the express provisions of  this Section
13,  the Committee shall have  conclusive authority to  construe and interpret
any  Stock  Option   Award  granted  under  this  Section  13   and  to  adopt
Administrative  Policies  with respect  thereto;  provided,  however, that  no
action shall  be taken  which  would prevent  the options  granted under  this
Section 13 or any Award  granted under the Plan from meeting  the requirements
for exemption from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or subsequent comparable
statute, as set  forth in  Rule 16b-3 of  the Exchange Act  or any  subsequent
comparable rule.

      (d)  Option Agreement.  The options granted hereunder shall be evidenced
by an option agreement,  dated as of  the date of  the grant, which  agreement
shall  be in  such form, consistent  with the  terms and  requirements of this
Section  13, as  shall be  approved  by the  Committee from  time to  time and
executed on  behalf of the  Company by  the President.   The Option  Agreement
shall require  the optionee to refrain from  selling or otherwise disposing of
shares so acquired for at least six months following the date of the  grant of
such option.

      (e) Option Period.  In the absence of any provision in  an option to the
contrary (i) the  option will become  exercisable as to 50%  of the shares  of
Common  Stock subject  to the option  upon completion  of the  first full year
after  the date thereof  and as to 50%  of such shares  upon the completion of
each full year thereafter prior to Termination, and (ii) the option will lapse
upon  the earliest of (A) 180 days  after Termination of the Director's status
as a Director, or (B) ten years after the option was granted. 

      (f) Transferability.  No  option granted under this Section  13 shall be
transferable  by the  non-employee Director  except  by will  or  the laws  of
descent and distribution, or pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order,
and during the Director's lifetime options may be exercised only by him or his
guardian  or  legal representative  or  his  transferee under  such  Qualified
Domestic Relations Order.

      (g) Limitations on  Exercise.  To the extent an  option is not otherwise
exercisable at the date of  the Director's death or voluntary retirement  as a
Director, it shall  become fully  exercisable upon  such retirement  provided,
however, that Director Stock  Options shall not become exercisable  under this
sentence prior to the expiration of six  months from the date of grant.   Upon
such death or  voluntary retirement, such options  shall be exercisable  for a
period of 180 days, subject to the original term of the option.

Section 14.  Payment of Awards

      Except as otherwise  provided herein Award Agreements  may provide that,
at  the discretion of the  Committee, payment of  Awards may be  made in cash,
Common Stock, a  combination of cash  and Common Stock, or  any other form  of
property as  the Committee shall determine.  The terms of Award Agreements may


provide for payment  of Awards in the form  of a lump sum or  installments, as
determined  by the Committee.   In connection with  transactions involving the
exercise and cancellation of an Award (under this Section 14 or Section 25, or
otherwise) held by or through  a Director or a Section 16 Officer  (whether or
not the transaction also involves the related  surrender and cancellation of a
stock option) and the receipt of cash in complete or partial settlement of the
Award,  or  the cash  settlement  of an  equity  security to  satisfy  the tax
withholding consequences of a  Derivative Security, the Committee may  require
that  such transaction be consummated  in compliance with  Rule 16b-3(e) under
the Exchange Act, as such rule may be amended or superseded from time to time,
unless the holder  of such Award waives such compliance  in a writing executed
by such  holder and delivered to  the Committee and the  Committee consents to
such waiver.

Section 15.  Dividends and Dividend Equivalents

      If an  Award is  granted in  the form  of  a Restricted  Stock Award  or
Phantom Stock Award, the Committee may choose, at the time of the grant of the
Award, to include as part of such Award an entitlement to receive dividends or
dividend  equivalents,  subject to  such  terms,  conditions, restrictions  or
limitations,  if any, as the  Committee may establish.  Dividends and dividend
equivalents  shall be  paid in such  form and manner  and at such  time as the
Committee shall determine. All dividends or dividend equivalents which are not
paid  currently  may, at  the Committee's  discretion,  accrue interest  or be
reinvested into additional shares of Common Stock.

Section 16.  Assignment and Transfer; Holding Period

      The rights  and interests of  a Participant under  the Plan, and  in any
Derivative  Security issued  or granted under  the Plan, may  not be assigned,
sold,  encumbered  or transferred  except,  in the  event  of the  death  of a
Participant,  by will  or  the laws  of descent  and  distribution, or  except
pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.

      Except as otherwise provided  in the first paragraph of  this Section 16
(but such exception shall not  apply if its application would cause  the grant
or  award of  the subject  equity security  or Derivative  Security not  to be
exempt from  section 16(b)  of the  Exchange Act), an  equity security  of the
Company granted or  awarded to a  Director or Section 16  Officer as an  Award
under  the  Plan  shall not  be  assigned.  sold,  encumbered, transferred  or
otherwise disposed  of prior to the expiration of  six months from the date of
grant, and neither a Derivative  Security granted or awarded to a  Director or
Section  16 Officer  as an  Award under  the Plan,  nor the  underlying equity
security  with respect to such  Derivative Security, shall  be assigned. sold,
encumbered,  transferred or otherwise disposed  of prior to  the expiration of
six months from the date of acquisition of the Derivative Security to the date
of  disposition  of  the Derivative  Security  (other  than  upon exercise  or
conversion)  or such underlying equity  security, unless, in  either case, the
holder of such equity security or Derivative  Security requests waiver of such
restrictions  in  a  writing delivered  to  the  Committee  and the  Committee
consents to such waiver.

Section 17.  Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization

      In the event of any change in the outstanding shares  of Common Stock by
reason of  any reorganization, recapitalization, stock  split, stock dividend,
combination  or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or any change in the
corporate structure or shares of the Company, the maximum aggregate number and
class of shares as to which Awards may be or are required to be  granted under
the Plan  and the shares  issuable pursuant  to and the  exercise or  purchase
price payable  under then outstanding Awards, shall  be appropriately adjusted
by the Committee whose determination shall be final.  Any such adjustments may
be provided for in Award Agreements.

Section 18.  Extraordinary Distributions and Pro Rata Repurchases


      In the event the Company shall at any time when an Award is  outstanding
make  an Extraordinary  Distribution  (as hereinafter  defined) in  respect of
Common Stock or effect a  Pro Rata Repurchase of Common Stock  (as hereinafter
defined),  the Committee may consider the economic impact of the Extraordinary
Distribution  or Pro Rata Repurchase on Participants and make such adjustments
as  it deems  equitable  under the  circumstances.  The determination  of  the
Committee  shall, subject to revision by the  Board of Directors, be final and
binding upon all Participants.

      (a)  As  used herein,  the term  "Extraordinary Distribution"  means any
dividend or other distribution by the Company of:
           (i)  cash, where  the  aggregate amount  of  such cash  dividend or
      distribution  together  with  the  amount  of  all  cash  dividends  and
      distributions  made  during the  twelve  months  preceding the  date  of
      payment of such dividend  or other distribution, when combined  with the
      aggregate  amount  of  all  Pro  Rata  Repurchases  (for  this  purpose,
      including only that portion of the aggregate purchase price  of such Pro
      Rata  Repurchases  which  is in  excess  of the  fair  market  value (as
      determined by the Committee) of the Common Stock repurchased during such
      twelve  month period), exceeds ten  percent (10%) of  the aggregate fair
      market value  (as determined by the  Committee) of all shares  of Common
      Stock outstanding on  the record date  for determining the  shareholders
      entitled to receive such Extraordinary Distribution; or

           (ii) any shares of  capital stock of the Company (other than shares
      of Common Stock), other  securities of the Company (including  evidences
      of indebtedness of  the Company),  or any other  investments, assets  or
      property  of  the Company  (including shares  of  any Subsidiary  of the
      Company), or any combination thereof.

      (b) As used herein "Pro Rata Repurchase" means any purchase of shares of
Common Stock by the Company or  any Subsidiary thereof, pursuant to any tender
offer or exchange offer  subject to section 13(e)  of the Exchange Act or  any
successor  provision  of law,  or  pursuant to  any  other offer  available to
substantially all holders of Common Stock; provided, however, that no purchase
of shares  of  the Company  or  any Subsidiary  thereof  made in  open  market
transactions shall be deemed a Pro Rata Repurchase.

Section 19.  Withholding Taxes

      The Company or  the applicable  Subsidiary shall be  entitled to  deduct
from any payment under the Plan, regardless  of the form of such payment,  the
amount  of all  applicable income  and employment  tax required  by law  to be
withheld with respect to such payment or may require the Participant to pay to
it such  tax prior to and  as a condition of  the making of such  payment.  In
accordance  with any  applicable Administrative  Policies it  establishes, the
Committee may allow a Participant to  pay the amount of taxes required  by law
to be withheld from  an Award by withholding from any payment  of Common Stock
due as a result of such Award, or by permitting the Participant to  deliver to
the Company shares  of Common Stock having a fair  market value, as determined
by the Committee, equal to the amount of such required withholding taxes.

Section 20.  Regulatory Approvals and Listings

      Notwithstanding anything contained  in this  Plan to  the contrary,  the
Company shall have  no obligation to  issue or deliver certificates  of Common
Stock  evidencing Restricted Stock Awards or any other Award payable in Common
Stock prior to (a) the obtaining of any approval from  any governmental agency
which the Company shall, in its  sole discretion, determine to be necessary or
advisable,  (b)  the admission  of such  shares to  trading on  the Applicable
Market and  (c) the completion  of any registration or  other qualification of
said shares under any state or Federal  law or ruling of any governmental body
which the  Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or
advisable. The Company shall  have the right to  require that any  certificate
for Common Stock issued pursuant. to the Plan or an Award bear any restrictive
legend required  by law and/or to evidence restrictions on the transfer of the


shares under applicable law, the Award Agreement or the Plan.

Section 21.  No Right to Continued Employment or Grants

      Participation in the  Plan shall not give any Key  Employee any right to
remain  in the employ  of, or continue to  be retained by,  the Company or any
Subsidiary. The Company or, in the case of employment with, or retention by, a
Subsidiary,  the Subsidiary, reserves the right to terminate the employment or
retention of  any  Key Employee  at any  time,  subject to  the terms  of  any
agreement  with such  Key Employee.  The adoption  of this  Plan shall  not be
deemed to  give any  Key  Employee or  any other  individual any  right to  be
selected as a Participant, to  be granted any Awards hereunder or,  if granted
an Award, to receive any additional Awards at any subsequent time.

Section 22.  Rights as Stockholder

      No Participant  shall have any  rights as a  stockholder as a  result of
participation in the Plan until the date of issuance of and only as the holder
of  a stock certificate  in his name  except, in the  case of Restricted Stock
Awards, to the extent such rights are granted to the Participant under Section
10(c) hereof.  To the extent  any person acquires a right to  receive payments
from the Company  under this Plan,  such rights shall  be no greater  than the
rights of an unsecured creditor of the Company.

Section 23.  Responsibility and Indemnification

      No member of the Board of Directors or the Committee shall be liable  to
the   Company,  any  Participant  or  any   third  party  for  any  action  or
determination  made  in  good  faith  with  respect  to  the  Plan  and Awards
thereunder,  or for  any  matter  as to  which  the Company's  certificate  of
incorporation or bylaws, or  any valid contract between  the Company and  such
member, limits  or negates the liability  of Directors. Such members  shall be
entitled  to indemnification and reimbursement  in the manner  provided in the
Company's  certificate  of incorporation  and  bylaws, in  any  valid contract

with changes in the Code, ERISA, or the rules thereunder.

or  changes of its  stock, securities,  capital or  business structure,  or to
merge, consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate, or to sell, lease or  transfer all
