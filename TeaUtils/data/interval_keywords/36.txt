                                PROXY STATEMENT
 
   
     The accompanying proxies are solicited by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on August
2, 1996 and any adjournments thereof.
    
 
     Holders of Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares of record at the
close of business on June 26, 1996 (the record date) will be entitled to vote at
the Annual Meeting. At that date the Corporation had issued and outstanding
2,183,603 Class A Common Shares without par value and 1,313,585 Class B Common
Shares without par value. Only Class B Common Shares are entitled to vote in the
election of the Corporation's Class II Directors, as described below. Except as
hereinafter described in respect of the election of Directors, (i) each Class A
Common Share is entitled to one vote on all matters properly coming before the
Annual Meeting, and each Class B Common Share is entitled to one-tenth (1/10th)
of one vote on all matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting, (ii) Class
A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares shall vote together as a single class
on all matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting, and (iii) an aggregate
of at least 1,748,595 Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares must be
represented at the meeting in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business.
 
   
     This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy were first mailed
to Shareholders on July 10, 1996.
    
 
                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
     The Corporation's Board of Directors currently consists of nine (9)
persons, divided into three classes (Classes I, II and III) consisting of three
Directors each. Only Class A Common Shares are entitled to vote for Directors in
Classes I and III and only Class B Common Shares are entitled to vote for
Directors in Class II.
<PAGE>   4
 
     At this Annual Meeting, Class II Directors are to be elected for a term
expiring at the 1999 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board of Directors has designated
the three (3) persons first named in the table below as nominees for Director
for such term. Each of the nominees presently is a Director.
 
     Pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended,
and in accordance with the procedures established by the American Stock
Exchange, the holders of Class B Common Shares are entitled to vote separately
as a class for the election of three Class II Directors. At least 656,793 Class
B Common Shares of the Corporation must be represented at the meeting in person
or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the election of such Directors.
The holders of Class A Common Shares are not entitled to vote in the election of
Class II Directors.
 
     Unless a holder of Class B Common Shares requests that voting of his or her
proxy be withheld for the nominees for election as Class II Directors in
accordance with the instructions set forth on such proxy, it presently is
intended that Class B Common Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby will
be voted for the election as Class II Directors of the nominees designated by
the Board of Directors. All nominees have consented to being named in this Proxy
Statement and to serve if elected. Should any nominee subsequently decline or be
unable to accept such nomination or to serve as a Director, an event which the
Board of Directors does not now expect, the persons voting the Class B Common
Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby may either vote such shares for a
substitute nominee for such class or for a reduced number of nominees, as they
may deem advisable.
 
     In the event holders of Class B Common Shares shall have the right to
cumulate their voting power for the election of Directors (see GENERAL
INFORMATION -- CUMULATIVE VOTING for the procedure required to initiate
cumulative voting), the persons designated as proxies will allocate the votes
among the nominees designated for election in accordance with their judgment.
Cumulative voting permits a holder of Class B Common Shares to give one nominee
a number of votes equal to the number of Directors to be elected by the holders
of Class B Common Shares multiplied by the number of Shares the Shareholder may
vote, or a holder of Class B Common Shares may distribute votes on the same
principle among two or three nominees.

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
     The Corporation's compensation program is administered by the Compensation
Committee, which consists exclusively of non-employee Directors. This
compensation program is designed and administered to align the interests of the
Corporation's executive officers and its other key employees with that of the
Corporation's Shareholders, to link compensation to the performance of the
Corporation as well as to individual contributions and to provide compensation
at a level which is competitive in the marketplace so that the Corporation can
continue to attract, motivate, and retain qualified management.

     The Corporation's compensation program for its executive officers
(including the named executive officers) and certain other key employees
consists of an annual salary, bonus (in some instances) and a long-term
incentive represented by stock options and, in some instances, deferred
compensation. The policies in respect of each of these elements, as well as the
basis for determining the compensation of the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, Mr. Robert S. Reitman (the "CEO"), are described below.
 
     The Compensation Committee establishes annual salaries to be competitive
with the marketplace and to reflect the varying levels of responsibilities of
the CEO and the other executive officers. Such salaries are based, in part, on
information provided to the Corporation by independent compensation consultants.
 
     The services of independent compensation consultants also are used by the
Corporation in respect of surveying compensation levels and trends in industry
generally and in respect of structuring the bonus component of the compensation
of the CEO and the other executive officers. For the Corporation's executive
officers, annual bonuses are based upon an evaluation of their respective
division's actual performance against its business plan. Assuming that
performance levels are achieved, the bonus paid is a predetermined percentage of
the division's pretax profits. In the event that predetermined standards are not
achieved, bonuses are subject to reduction. In addition to earnings performance,
the Compensation Committee evaluates other managerial achievements of the
Corporation's executive officers as a component of bonus awards.
 
     The Compensation Committee determines the annual bonus of the CEO based
upon the Corporation's sales, pretax income and return on investment
(collectively, the "Corporation Components") as well as upon a subjective factor
designed to reward individual performance independent of the Corporation
Components. The CEO's bonus is determined in part based upon the Corporation's
attaining certain threshold, target and maximum Corporation Component levels,
which levels are established based upon a Board-approved business plan for the
Corporation. The CEO's fiscal 1996 bonus was determined by weighting the
Corporation Components as follows: 45% of his 1996 bonus was based upon the
levels of Corporation Components achieved (each bearing equal weight) and 55%
was determined subjectively based upon the CEO's overall contributions to the
Corporation.
 
     Stock options are awarded to the Corporation's executive officers in
accordance with plans approved by the Shareholders. During the fiscal year ended
February 29, 1996, options were available for grant only under the Corporation's
1995 Incentive
 
                                        6

Stock Option Plan (The "1995 Plan"). Subject to certain limitations and based
upon management input, the Compensation Committee determines the persons to whom
options will be granted and the numbers of shares to be represented by such
options. In general, the Compensation Committee has awarded options based upon
the individual's position with the Corporation and potential contribution to
corporate profitability. The 1995 Plan provides for the granting of incentive
stock options for Class B Common Shares, the option price of which may not be
less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant.
However, in the case of an optionee who owns or is deemed to own shares of the
Corporation representing more than 10% of the total voting power of all classes
of the Corporation's shares at the time an option is granted (currently the CEO
and two other executive officers), the option price may not be less than 110% of
the fair market value of such shares on the date of grant. During the fiscal
year ended February 29, 1996, stock options were granted under the 1995 Plan to
the named executive officers in amounts indicated later in this Proxy Statement.
It is the intention of the Compensation Committee that such grants constitute an
additional tie between the Corporation's performance and executive compensation
while further aligning the common long-term interests of the Corporation's
executive officers and its Shareholders.
 
     Stock options also have been granted to certain executive officers pursuant
to their employment agreements with the Corporation (one of which employment
agreements now is terminated). Such options were designed to tie the interests
of such executive officers, as new employees of the Corporation, to the interest
of the Corporation's Shareholders and to retain those executive officers by
linking the exercisability of their options to their continued employment with
the Corporation.
 
     In addition, the Corporation has adopted for many of its employees various
benefit plans in which the executive officers are permitted to participate,
subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the
benefits that may be payable under the plans.
                                       The Compensation Committee:
 
                                       James H. Berick, Chairman

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS
 
     In 1990, the Corporation entered into employment agreements with Robert S.
Reitman and Morton L. Reitman. Robert S. Reitman's employment agreement, which
expires in June 1997, currently provides for an annual salary of $425,000, which
salary may be reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine
if the same should be increased. Robert S. Reitman's employment agreement also
provides for payment to Mr. Reitman of an annual incentive based upon certain
performance criteria, the maximum of which amount shall be not less than
$160,000, and for certain disability benefits.
 
     Morton L. Reitman's employment agreement with the Corporation, which
expires in June 1996, currently provides for an annual salary of $303,000, which
salary may be reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee to determine
if the same should be increased, and for certain disability benefits. Morton L.
Reitman also has a consultant agreement with the Corporation providing for
payment to Mr. Reitman for consulting services in the amount of $72,000 per
year, for a term of three years commencing upon the termination of his
employment.
 
     In 1991, the Corporation entered into an employment agreement with James C.
Spira. Mr. Spira's employment agreement, which terminated October 31, 1995,
provided for an annual salary of $273,000. In addition, pursuant to Mr. Spira's
employment agreement, the Corporation granted to Mr. Spira options to purchase
70,000 Class B Common Shares of the Corporation, the exercise price of which
options is $14.50, the fair market value of such shares on the date of the
grant. 34,000 of the options became exercisable prior to the termination of Mr.
Spira's employment and Mr. Spira may exercise such options until February 29,
2000. Mr. Spira's remaining 36,000 unvested options expired on October 31, 1995.
 
     In March 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation entered into an
employment agreement with Mr. Dennis H. Kelly. Mr. Kelly's employment agreement,
which expires in February 1998, currently provides for an annual salary of
$124,000 plus incentives based upon performance.
 
     The Corporation also has deferred compensation agreements with certain key
employees which provide for benefits for a term of 10 years following
retirement, disability or death. These benefits vary according to the employee's
corporate responsibility and the age of the employee at the date of such event.
The ranges of annual benefits under the deferred compensation agreements for
Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and Morton L. Reitman during the first five years of
said term are $34,800 to $68,400
 
                                       12
<PAGE>   15
 
and $15,600 to $36,600, respectively. The amount of benefits payable to such
executive officers during the second five years of the term is 75% of the
benefit payable during the first five years.
 
     The benefits payable to Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and Morton L. Reitman
under the deferred compensation agreements will be replaced with the benefits
payable to them under the Corporation's 1992 Supplemental Benefit Plan (the
"Supplemental Benefit Plan") upon the vesting of each such individual's rights
in that plan. Vesting under the Supplemental Benefit Plan does not occur unless
and until that individual has been a participant in the plan for 10 years or has
attained age 65, whichever first occurs; provided, however, that a participant
who becomes disabled or dies shall be vested after six years of employment by
the Corporation. In addition, in the event that effective control of the
Corporation changes from that management in control at the date of adoption of
the Supplemental Benefit Plan, all participants immediately vest in the plan
benefits. Under the Supplemental Benefit Plan, Messrs. Robert S. Reitman and
Morton L. Reitman will receive $140,000 and $60,000, respectively, in annual
benefits for a term of 15 years following their retirement, death or disability.
In the event that either individual's rights under the Supplemental Benefit Plan
fail to vest, then the benefits under the deferred compensation agreements
remain payable to such non-vested individual.
 
                 BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF CLASS A COMMON SHARES
                           AND CLASS B COMMON SHARES
 
     The following tables, together with the accompanying footnotes, describe
the beneficial ownership of the Corporation's Class A Common Shares and Class B
Common Shares as of June 26, 1996 (except as otherwise indicated) of (1) each
person who was known to the Corporation to be the beneficial owner of more than
five percent of the total Shares of either class issued and outstanding on such
date, (2) each current Director and nominee for election as Director, as well as
all executive officers and Directors as a group and (3) all Shareholders, other
than Current Directors, nominees and executive officers, as a group. In
addition, the following tables set forth the aggregate voting power of each of
the aforementioned persons both prior to the proposed conversion of Class B
Common Shares into Class A Common Shares (see the proposal commencing on Page 19
of this proxy statement) and after giving effect to such conversion. Except as
otherwise indicated, the share figures shown below are based upon information
supplied by the named individuals and group members described in the tables and
the Corporation's records.
 
                                       13
<PAGE>   16
 
     As used in the tables, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of all
shares in respect of which such person has or shares voting or investment power
(regardless of whether such individual is entitled to receive any economic
benefits derived from such shares). As used herein, "voting power" means the
power to vote, or to direct the voting of, shares and "investment power" means
the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, shares. Also, included
are shares which were not owned on June 26, 1996 but which can be acquired
within 60 days after that date.
 
     As indicated specifically in the footnotes to the tables, certain Class A
Common Shares and Class B Common Shares included for the named individuals in
each table below are deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one of such
named individuals and, as a result, have been so reported. Certain individuals
listed in the tables have disclaimed beneficial ownership with respect to some
of the Shares disclosed as beneficially owned under the definition set forth
above.

                 PROPOSAL: CONVERSION OF CLASS B COMMON SHARES
                 TO CLASS A COMMON SHARES, AND AMENDMENT TO THE
                 AMENDED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE
               THE CLASS B COMMON SHARES, REDESIGNATE THE CLASS A
               COMMON SHARES AS "COMMON SHARES", AND PROVIDE THAT
           THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES SHALL BE 12,000,000
 
INTRODUCTION
 
     At its meeting held April 29, 1996, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation approved, and determined to submit to the shareholders for their
approval, (i) the conversion of Class B Common Shares to Class A Common Shares
(the "Conversion") and (ii) an amendment (referred to in this Section of the
proxy statement as the "Amendment") to Article Fourth of the Corporation's
Amended Articles of Incorporation to (a) eliminate the Class B Common Shares,
(b) redesignate the Class A Common Shares as "Common Shares" (the "Common
Shares"), and (c) provide that the number of authorized Common Shares shall be
12,000,000.
 
   
     Following shareholder approval of the Conversion and the Amendment and
approval for listing of the additional Common Shares to be issued upon the
Conversion on the American Stock Exchange, the Class B Common Shares shall be
converted to Class A Common Shares. Upon the Conversion, each Class B Common
Share outstanding will be converted to one Class A Common Share (the "Converted
Shares") and all Class A Common Shares (including the Converted Shares) will be
redesignated as "Common Shares". The affirmative vote of holders of a majority
of the outstanding Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, voting as separate classes, is
required to adopt this proposal.
    
 
     The foregoing items as well as other matters in respect of the Conversion
and the Amendment are discussed in greater detail below.
 
PURPOSE
 
     The Class B Common Shares were authorized in 1988 primarily to enable the
Corporation to raise capital for acquisitions, expansion or general corporate
purposes through the issuance of Class B Common Shares or debt securities
convertible into such shares. Since the authorization of the Class B Common
Shares, there has existed no need to utilize such shares for capital raising
purposes and the Board of Directors presently does not anticipate such a need in
the future. Accordingly, the Board of
 
                                       19
<PAGE>   22
 
Directors believes that it would be in the best interests of the Corporation to
convert the outstanding Class B Common Shares into Class A Common Shares to
simplify the Corporation's capital stock structure and potentially to increase
the liquidity in the market for the holders of the Class A Common Shares and
Class B Common Shares. After the Conversion of the Class B Common Shares and the
redesignation of the Class A Common Shares, the Corporation's capital stock will
consist only of two classes, Common Shares without par value and Serial
Preferred Shares without par value. No Serial Preferred Shares are outstanding.
The Amendment will effect the redesignation of the Class A Common Shares as
"Common Shares" and provide that the number of authorized Common Shares shall be
12,000,000, the aggregate number of presently authorized Class A Common Shares
and Class B Common Shares.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE REDESIGNATED COMMON SHARES
 
   
     The express terms of the Common Shares shall be identical in all respects
to the Class A Common Shares, other than in respect of the election of Directors
and there will be no right to convert the Common Shares to shares of any other
class. Those terms are set forth in full in the Amendment, the text of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit A. The following summary is qualified in its entirety
by reference to Exhibit A.
    
 
     1. Voting. Subsequent to the Conversion, each Common Share will entitle the
holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including
the election of Directors in each of the three existing classes. Presently, each
Class A Common Share entitles the holder to one vote and each Class B Common
Share entitles the holder to one-tenth of one vote. The Class A Common Shares
and the Class B Common Shares presently are voted together as a single class,
except that only the holders of Class A Common Shares are entitled to vote for
Directors in Classes I and III and only the holders of Class B Common Shares are
entitled to vote for Directors in Class II (the Class subject to election at
this Annual Meeting). Notwithstanding the Conversion, the Directors in Class II
elected at this Annual Meeting by the holders of Class B Common Shares will
serve their designated term and until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified.
 
     The following information sets forth the aggregate voting power of three
hypothetical shareholders both before and after the Conversion (based upon an
aggregate of 2,314,961.5 and 3,497,188 votes available before and after the
Conversion, respectively). A Shareholder owning 1,000 Class A Common Shares and
no Class B Common Shares would have .0433% of the voting power before the
Conversion and .0285% after the Conversion. A Shareholder owning 1,000 Class A
Common Shares and 500
 
                                       20
<PAGE>   23
 
Class B Common Shares would have .0454% of the voting power before the
Conversion and .0429% after the Conversion. A Shareholder owning 1,000 Class A
Common Shares and 1,000 Class B Common Shares would have .0475% of the voting
power before the Conversion and .0572% after the Conversion.
 
     Under Ohio law, the vote of holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding Common Shares will be required for any amendment to the Articles
which would change the express terms of such shares in any manner substantially
prejudicial to the holders thereof.
 
   
     2. Dividends. The Board of Directors intends to pay dividends on the Common
Shares, following shareholder approval of the Conversion, from funds legally
available therefor. The Board of Directors anticipates that the aggregate amount
of such dividends to the holders of Common Shares will increase over the
combined aggregate dividends paid in recent quarters to the holders of Class A
Common Shares and Class B Common Shares. However, the Board of Directors
anticipates that initially such dividend will be $.07 per quarter, which is less
than the dividend currently paid to holders of Class B Common Shares. The
Corporation declared the following cash dividends in the second fiscal quarter
of 1997 and has paid the following cash dividends in the first fiscal quarter of
1997 and in its last two fiscal years ended February 29 and 28, respectively:

*To be paid July 16, 1996 to shareholders of record June 28, 1996.
    
 
No assurance can be given as to the payment of any dividends in the future or
the amounts thereof. The Corporation is not in arrears in dividends in respect
of either Class A Common Shares or Class B Common Shares.
 
     3. Transferability. The Common Shares will be transferrable freely and will
be listed for trading under the symbol "TNZ", on the American Stock Exchange, on
which Exchange the Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares currently are
listed. However, no assurance can be given as to the price at which the Common
Shares will trade.

<PAGE>   24
 
     4. Other. The Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares do not, and
the Common Shares will not, carry any pre-emptive rights enabling a holder to
subscribe or receive shares of the Corporation. The Board of Directors will
continue to possess the power to issue authorized but unissued Common Shares
without further shareholder action. The Shareholder's equity of each holder of
Class A Common Shares and of Class B Common Shares will not be diluted or
otherwise affected by reason of the Conversion.
 
DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS
 
   
     Any holder of Class B Common Shares who does not vote any such shares in
favor of this proposal is entitled to make written demand for the payment to
such shareholder of the fair cash value of its Class B Common Shares not so
voted. The written demand must be delivered by such shareholder to the
Corporation not later than August 12, 1996 and must contain such shareholder's
address, the number of Class B Common Shares not voted in favor of this
proposal, and the amount claimed by such shareholder as the fair cash value of
such shares. In the event any such shareholder does not make the aforementioned
written demand in accordance with this paragraph and in accordance with Section
1701.85 of the Ohio Revised Code, such shareholder's right to demand payment of
the fair cash value of its Class B Common Shares not voted in favor of this
proposal will terminate.
    
 
     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL CONCERNING THE
CONVERSION OF CLASS B COMMON SHARES INTO CLASS A COMMON SHARES AND THE AMENDMENT
TO THE AMENDED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE THE CLASS B COMMON SHARES,
REDESIGNATE THE CLASS A COMMON SHARES AS "COMMON SHARES" AND PROVIDE THAT THE
AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES SHALL BE 12,000,000.
 
                             SELECTION OF AUDITORS
 
     The Board of Directors of the Corporation has recommended that KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP be selected as independent auditors to examine the books, records
and accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending
February 28, 1997. In accordance with past practice, the recommendation is being
presented to holders of Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares for
adoption or rejection at the Annual Meeting. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP were the
independent auditors of the Corporation for the fiscal year ended February 29,
1996 and are considered by the Board of Directors to be well qualified.
Representatives of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP are expected to be present at the
Annual Meeting with the
 
                                       22
<PAGE>   25
 
opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be
available to respond to appropriate questions.
 
                        COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF
                      THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
 
   
     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
Corporation's executive officers and Directors, and persons who beneficially own
more than 10% of the Corporation's Common Shares, to file reports of ownership
and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. James C.
Spira reported the expiration of stock options in October, 1995 subsequent to
the due date for such reporting.
    
 
                                 OTHER MATTERS
 
     The Board of Directors knows of no matter to be presented for action at the
Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. Should other
matters come before the meeting, the Class A Common Shares and Class B Common
Shares represented by proxies solicited hereby will be voted with respect
thereto in accordance with the best judgment of the proxy holders.
 
                              GENERAL INFORMATION
 
CUMULATIVE VOTING
 
     If notice in writing is given by any holder of Class B Common Shares to the
President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Corporation, not less than
forty-eight hours before the time fixed for the holding of the Annual Meeting,
that such Shareholder desires that the voting with respect to the election of
Directors shall be cumulative, and if an announcement of the giving of such
notice is made upon the convening of the meeting by the Chairman or Secretary of
the Meeting or by or on behalf of the Shareholder giving such notice, each
holder of Class B Common Shares shall have the right to cumulate such voting
power as he or she possesses at such election. If the Shareholder desires to
make the foregoing announcement at the convening of the meeting, such
Shareholder must be present in person or through a properly authorized
representative other than those persons designated in the accompanying form of
proxy.

VOTING OF PROXIES
 
     Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares represented by properly
executed Management proxies will be voted at the meeting, and if a holder of
such shares has specified how the same are to be voted, they will be voted in
accordance with such specification. It is intended that Class B Common Shares
represented by proxies in which no specification has been made will be voted for
the election of Directors and Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares
represented by proxies in which no specification has been made will be voted for
the proposal to convert the Class B Common Shares and amend the Amended Articles
of Incorporation and for the selection of the independent auditors.
 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
 
     If a holder of Class A Common Shares or Class B Common Shares intends to
present a proposal at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders presently
scheduled for June 16, 1997, it must be received by the Corporation for
consideration for inclusion in the Corporation's Proxy Statement and form of
proxy relating to that meeting on or before January 12, 1997.
 
REVOCATION OF PROXIES
 
     A proxy may be revoked at any time before a vote is taken or the authority
granted is otherwise exercised. Revocation may be accomplished by the execution
of a later proxy with regard to the same Class A Common Shares or Class B Common
Shares, as the case may be, or by giving notice in writing or in open meeting.
 
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
 
     The cost of soliciting the accompanying proxies will be borne by the
Corporation. The Corporation does not expect to pay any compensation for the
solicitation of proxies but may pay brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and
custodians their reasonable expenses for sending proxy material to principals
and obtaining their instructions. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies
may be solicited in person, by telephone or telegraph, or by Directors, officers
and regular employees of the Corporation.

                                   EXHIBIT A
 
              AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF ARTICLE "FOURTH" OF THE
                       AMENDED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
 
     FOURTH:  Effective upon the filing of this Amendment, each outstanding
Class B Common Share of the Corporation shall be converted into one Class A
Common Share of the Corporation, all authorized but unissued Class B Common
Shares shall be eliminated, and the Class A Common Shares shall be redesignated
as Common Shares. Thereupon, the number of shares which the Corporation is
authorized to have outstanding shall be 12,200,000 consisting of (i) 12,000,000
Common Shares without par value (collectively, the "Common Shares" and
individually, a "Common Share") and (ii) 200,000 Serial Preferred Shares without
par value ("Serial Preferred Shares").
 
     The shares of such classes shall have the following express terms:
 
                                   DIVISION A
 
                         EXPRESS TERMS OF COMMON SHARES
 
     The Common Shares shall be subject to the express terms of the Serial
Preferred Shares and any series thereof. Each Common Share shall be equal to
every other Common Share. Each holder of Common Shares shall be entitled to one
vote for each Common Share so held upon all matters presented to Shareholders.
The Common Shares will not carry any pre-emptive rights enabling a holder to
subscribe or receive shares of the Corporation. The Board of Directors shall
possess the power to issue authorized but unissued Common Shares without further
shareholder action.
 
                                   DIVISION B
 
                    EXPRESS TERMS OF SERIAL PREFERRED SHARES
 
   
     Section 1.  Serial Preferred Shares may be issued from time to time in one
or more series. All Serial Preferred Shares shall be of equal rank and shall be
identical, except in respect of the matters that may be fixed by the Board of
Directors as hereinafter provided, and each share of each series shall be
identical with all other shares of such series, except as to the date from which
dividends are cumulative.
    
 
                                       A-1
<PAGE>   29
 
     Subject to the provisions of Section 2 to 7, inclusive, of this Division B,
which provisions shall apply to all Serial Preferred Shares, the Board of
Directors hereby is authorized to cause Serial Preferred Shares to be issued in
one or more series and with respect to each such series prior to the issuance
thereof to fix:
 
          (a)  The designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing
     number, letter or title.
 
          (b)  The number of shares of the series, which number the Board of
     Directors may (except where otherwise provided in the creation of the
     series) increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares thereof
     then outstanding).
 
          (c)  The annual dividend rate of the series.
 
          (d)  The dates at which dividends, if declared, shall be payable, and
     the dates from which dividends shall be cumulative.
 
          (e)  The redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of
     the series.
 
          (f)  The terms and amount of any sinking fund provided for the
     purchase or redemption of shares of the series.
 
          (g)  The amounts payable on shares of the series in the event of any
     voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
     affairs of the Corporation.
 
          (h)  Whether the shares of the series shall be convertible into Common
     Shares, and, if so, the conversion price or prices, any adjustments
     thereof, and all other terms and conditions upon which such conversion may
     be made.
 
          (i)  Restrictions (in addition to those set forth in Section 6(b) of
     this Division) on the issuance of shares of the same series or of any other
     class or series.
 
     The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt from time to time amendments
to the Amended Articles of Incorporation fixing, with respect to each such
series, the matters described in clauses (a) to (i), inclusive, of this Section
1.
 
   
     Section 2.  The holders of Serial Preferred Shares of each series, in
preference to the holders of Common Shares and of any other class of shares
ranking junior to the Serial Preferred Shares, shall be entitled to receive out
of any funds legally available
    
 
                                       A-2
<PAGE>   30
 
and when and as declared by the Board of Directors, dividends in cash at the
rate for such series fixed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of
this Division B and no more, payable quarterly on the dates fixed for such
series. Such dividends shall be cumulative, in the case of shares of each
particular series, from and after the date or dates fixed with respect to such
series. No dividends may be paid upon or declared or set apart for any of the
Serial Preferred Shares for any quarterly dividend period unless at the same
time a like proportionate dividend for the same quarterly dividend period,
ratably in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor,
shall be paid upon or declared or set apart for all Serial Preferred Shares of
all series then issued and outstanding and entitled to receive such dividend.
 
     Section 3.  In no event so long as any Serial Preferred Shares shall be
outstanding shall any dividends, except a dividend payable in Common Shares or
other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preferred Shares be paid or declared
or any distribution be made except as aforesaid on the Common Shares or any
other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preferred Shares, nor shall any Common
Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Serial Preferred Shares be
purchased, retired or otherwise acquired by the Corporation (except out of the
proceeds of the sale of Common Shares or other shares ranking junior to the
Serial Preferred Shares received by the Corporation on or subsequent to the date
on which the Serial Preferred Shares authorized herein are first issued):
 
          (a) Unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on Serial Preferred
     Shares, including the full dividends for the current dividend period, shall
     have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for payment thereof set
     apart; and
 
          (b) Unless there shall be no arrearages with respect to the redemption
     of Serial Preferred Shares of any series from any sinking fund provided for
     shares of such series in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of
     this Division B.
 
     Section 4.
 
   
          (a)  Subject to the express terms of each series and to the provisions
     of Section 6(b) (iii) of this Division B, the Corporation may from time to
     time redeem all or any part of the Serial Preferred Shares of any series at
     the time outstanding (i) at the option of the Board of Directors at the
     applicable redemption price for such series fixed in accordance with the
     provisions of Section 1 of this Division B, or (ii) in fulfillment of the
     requirements of any sinking fund provided for shares of such series at the
     applicable sinking fund redemption price, fixed in accordance with the
     provisions of Section 1 of this Division B,
    
 
                                       A-3
<PAGE>   31
 
     together in each case with an amount equal to all dividends accrued and
     unpaid thereon (whether or not such dividends shall have been earned or
     declared) to the redemption date.
 
          (b)  Notice of every such redemption shall be mailed, postage prepaid
     to the holders of record of the Serial Preferred Shares to be redeemed at
     their respective addresses then appearing on the books of the Corporation,
     not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for
     such redemption. At any time before or after notice has been given as above
     provided, the Corporation may deposit the aggregate redemption price of the
     Serial Preferred Shares to be redeemed with any bank or trust company in
     Cleveland, Ohio or New York, New York, having capital and surplus of more
     than $5,000,000, named in such notice, and direct that such deposited
     amount be paid to the respective holders of the Serial Preferred Shares so
     to be redeemed, in amounts equal to the redemption price of all Serial
     Preferred Shares so to be redeemed, on surrender of the share certificate
     or certificates held by such holders. Upon the making of such deposit such
     holders shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares, and
     after such notice shall have been given and such deposit shall have been
     made such holders shall have no interest in or claim against the
     Corporation with respect to such shares except only to receive such money
     from such bank or trust company without interest or the right to exercise,
     before the redemption date, any unexpired privileges conversion. In case
     less than all of the outstanding Serial Preferred Shares are to be
     redeemed, the Corporation shall select pro rata or by lot the shares so to
     be redeemed in such manner as shall be prescribed by its Board of
     Directors. If the holders of Serial Preferred Shares which shall have been
     called for redemption shall not, within six years after such deposit, claim
     the amount deposited for the redemption thereof, any such bank or trust
     company shall, upon demand, pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed
     amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company and the Corporation shall
     be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and to such holders.
 
   
          (c)  Any Serial Preferred Shares which are redeemed by the Corporation
     pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4 and any Serial Preferred
     Shares which are purchased and delivered in satisfaction of any sinking
     fund requirements provided for shares of such series and any Serial
     Preferred Shares which are converted in accordance with the express terms
     thereof shall be cancelled and not reissued. Any Serial Preferred Shares
     otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall resume the status of authorized
     and unissued Serial Preferred Shares without serial designation.
    
 
                                       A-4
<PAGE>   32
 
     Section 5.
 
          (a)  The holders of Serial Preferred Shares of any series shall, in
     case of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
     Corporation, be entitled to receive in full out of the assets of the
     Corporation, including its capital, before any amount shall be paid or
     distributed among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares
     ranking junior to the Serial Preferred Shares, the amounts fixed with
     respect to shares of such series in accordance with Section I of this
     Division B, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid
     thereon (whether or not such dividends shall have been earned or declared)
     to the date of payment of the amount due pursuant to such liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation. In case the
     net assets of the Corporation legally available therefor are insufficient
     to permit the payment upon all outstanding Serial Preferred Shares and any
     shares ranking on a parity therewith of the full preferential amount to
     which they are respectively entitled, then such net assets shall be
     distributed ratably upon outstanding Serial Preferred Shares and any shares
     ranking on a parity therewith in proportion to the full preferential amount
     to which each such share is entitled.
 
          After payment to holders of Serial Preferred Shares of the full
     preferential amounts as aforesaid, holders of Serial Preferred Shares as
     such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the
     Corporation.
 
          (b)  The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any
     other corporation, or the merger of any other corporation into it, or the
     sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all the property or
     business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to be a dissolution,
     liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Section 5.
 
     Section 6.
 
   
          (a)  The holders of Serial Preferred Shares shall be entitled to one
     vote for each share; and, except as otherwise provided herein or required
     by law, the holders of Serial Preferred Shares and the holders of Common
     Shares shall vote together as one class on all matters. No adjustment of
     the voting rights of holders of Serial Preferred Shares shall be made for
     an increase or decrease in the number of Common Shares authorized or issued
     or for share splits or combinations of the Common Shares or for share
     dividends on any class of shares payable solely in Common Shares.
    
 
                                       A-5
<PAGE>   33
 
          If, and so often as, the Corporation shall be in default in dividends
     in an amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends on any series of
     Serial Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, whether or not earned or
     declared, the holders of Serial Preferred Shares of all series, voting
     separately as a class and in addition to all other rights to vote for
     Directors, shall be entitled to elect, as herein provided, two members of
     the Board of Directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that the
     holders of Serial Preferred Shares shall not have or exercise such special
     class voting rights except at meetings of the shareholders for the election
     of Directors at which the holders of not less than 45% of the outstanding
     Serial Preferred Shares of all series then outstanding are present in
     person or by proxy; and provided further that the special class voting
     rights provided for herein when the same shall have become vested shall
     remain so vested until all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Serial
     Preferred Shares of all series then outstanding shall have been paid,
     whereupon the holders of Serial Preferred Shares shall be divested of their
     special class voting rights in respect of subsequent elections of
     Directors, subject to the revesting of such special class voting rights in
     the event hereinabove specified in this paragraph.
 
          In the event of default entitling the holders of Serial Preferred
     Shares to elect two Directors as above specified, a special meeting of the
     shareholders for the purpose of electing such Directors shall be called by
     the Secretary of the Corporation upon written request of, or may be called
     by, the holders of record of at least 15% of the Serial Preferred Shares of
     all series at the time outstanding, and notice thereof shall be given in
     the same manner as that required for the annual meeting of shareholders;
     provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to call such
     special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders shall be held within
     90 days after the date of receipt of the foregoing written request from the
     holders of Serial Preferred Shares. At any meeting at which the holders of
     Serial Preferred Shares shall be entitled to elect Directors, the holders
     of 45% of the then outstanding Serial Preferred Shares of all series,
     present in person or by proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum,
     and the vote of the holders of a majority of such shares so present at any
     such meeting at which there shall be such a quorum shall be sufficient to
     elect the members of the Board of Directors which the holders of Serial
     Preferred Shares are entitled to elect as hereinabove provided.
 
   
          The two Directors who may be elected by the holders of Serial
     Preferred Shares pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall be in addition
     to any other Directors then in office or proposed to be elected otherwise
     than pursuant to such
    
 
                                       A-6
<PAGE>   34
 
     provisions, and nothing in such provisions shall prevent any change
     otherwise permitted in the total number of Directors of the Corporation or
     require the resignation of any Director elected otherwise than pursuant to
     such provisions.
 
          (b)  The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
     Serial Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, given in person or by
     proxy at a meeting called for the purpose at which the holders of Serial
     Preferred Shares shall vote separately as a class, shall be necessary to
     effect any one or more of the following (but so far as the holders of
     Serial Preferred Shares are concerned, such action may be effected with
     such vote):
 
             (i)  Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions
        of the Amended Articles of Incorporation or of the Code of Regulations
        of the Corporation which affects adversely the voting powers, rights or
        preferences of the holders of Serial Preferred Shares; provided,
        however, that, for the purpose of this clause (i) only, neither the
        amendment of the Amended Articles of Incorporation so as to authorize or
        create, or to increase the authorized or outstanding amount of, Serial
        Preferred Shares or of any shares of any class ranking on a parity with
        or junior to the Serial Preferred Shares, nor the amendment of the
        provisions of the Code of Regulations so as to increase the number of
        Directors of the Corporation, shall be deemed to affect adversely the
        voting powers, rights or preferences of the holders of Serial Preferred
        Shares; and provided further, that if such amendment, alteration or
        repeal affects adversely the rights or preferences of one or more but
        not all series of Serial Preferred Shares at the time outstanding, only
        the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the number of the
        shares at the time outstanding of the series so affected shall be
        required;
 
             (ii)  The authorization or creation of, or the increase in the
        authorized amount of, any shares of any class, or any security
        convertible into shares of any class, ranking prior to the Serial
        Preferred Shares;
 
   
             (iii)  The purchase or redemption (for sinking fund purposes or
        otherwise) of less than all of the Serial Preferred Shares then
        outstanding except in accordance with a share purchase offer made to all
        holders of record of Serial Preferred Shares, unless all dividends upon
        all Serial Preferred Shares then outstanding for all previous quarterly
        dividend periods shall have been declared and paid or funds therefor set

        Dear Shareholder,
 
        Included in this year's proxy statement, is a proposal by the
        Corporation's Board of Directors to consolidate the Corporation's
        two classes of Common Shares. The recommendation has been made
        for the purpose of simplifying the Corporation's capital stock
        structure and potentially increasing the liquidity in the market
        for all Tranzonic shareholders.
 
        We urge you to read thoroughly the entire proxy statement, but
        call your particular attention to the information beginning on
        page 19 concerning the purpose of the consolidation proposal and
        its impact upon your dividends.
 
        As always, we appreciate your interest in and support of the
        Corporation.
 
        Robert S. Reitman
        Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
 
     Although financial results in fiscal 1996 were disappointing, several
aspects of Tranzonic's performance suggest that we should emerge successfully
from that difficult period. Each of our divisions produced record sales, and all
were profitable during the year ended February 29th.

     Fiscal 1996 consolidated sales from continuing operations grew to $137.2
million, up 8.1 percent from the $126.9 million recorded a year earlier.
However, throughout the year we experienced mounting pressure on profit margins
primarily as a result of raw material cost increases, customer pricing demands
and competition for market share. These market conditions, combined with changes
in product mix, led to a 5.8 percent decline in operating earnings from
continuing operations to $7.2 million. The comparable number last fiscal year
was $7.6 million.

     While we have been able to improve operating efficiency, effect cost
savings through our materials procurement practices, and obtain price increases
in some markets, the struggle to preserve margins has been particularly acute in
certain retail segments of our business. Over the past year, we have been
evaluating the opportunities in each of the markets we serve, and reassessing
how best to deploy our resources to achieve long-term profitable growth. This
process included analysis of the factors influencing growth and of the
investment requirements necessary to achieve our goals.

     From this assessment, we determined that changes occurring in the retail
marketplace limit the opportunity for adequate earnings growth and return in
relation to the market risks. Thus, we concluded to reduce our involvement in
certain consumer products.

     To accomplish this, in late February 1996 we entered into a definitive
agreement to sell our Housewares Division, which principally markets laundry and
closet storage products to mass merchants and specialty retailers, to Whitney
Corr.Pak International, Inc. We completed the sale on March 29, 1996. As a
result of this divestiture, we incurred a one-time fourth quarter non-cash,
after-tax charge of $7.3 million. Together with earnings from discontinued
operations of $410 thousand net of tax, the fourth quarter loss from
discontinued operations totaled $6.8 million, or $1.94 per share, result-

ing in a net loss of $2.4 million for the year. On a per share basis, the
quarter and full year net loss totaled $1.58 and $.69 per share, respectively.

     In addition, the douche and enema product lines manufactured by our
Hospital Specialty unit were sold in February 1996, for cash, to NutraMax
Products, Inc., based in Gloucester, Massachusetts. This transaction served to
reduce further our exposure to a particularly price-sensitive segment of the
retail marketplace.

                         THE DIVESTITURES IN PERSPECTIVE

     A significant aspect of our long-term growth plan is to become more
important to each of our customers. We have worked toward that objective by
broadening our product line offerings through internal expansion and
acquisitions. Our investment in building the housewares business from
approximately $3 million when we entered that market in 1988 to $24 million last
year met our original revenue growth objectives. We achieved that level of scale
through internal growth and the four acquisitions that comprised Design Trend,
which would have served us well in the retail environment we entered in 1988.

     However, consumer price sensitivity, coupled with the immense purchasing
and pricing power of mass merchandisers, substantially increased the threshold
of scale required to achieve reasonable profitability. Indeed, even large
players in the housewares market balked at raising prices last year--despite
dramatic increases in raw material costs--in the face of pressure from
mass-merchants and specialty retailers.

     While such market dynamics may be cyclical, the more important reason for
exiting what has become a very intense retail arena is that it enables us to
focus financial and management resources on growing our businesses which serve
industrial and institutional markets. It is those areas served by our three
remaining business units--Hospital Specialty, CCP Industries and Baxter Tube--in
which we have special experience and knowledge, historically have earned better
margins and a higher rate of return, and see the greatest long-term opportunity.

                    CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF CORE STRATEGIES

     Building upon the established foundations of each of our remaining
businesses is our first priority going forward. We remain committed to becoming
a much larger company able to deliver profitable growth and a corresponding
increase in shareholder value. That will be achieved by implementing our core
strategies discussed in this letter a year ago, namely: focusing on customers,
implementing technology, and enabling human resource development.

     To expand our importance to customers and our customer base, we
aggressively seek acquisitions which add to our array of complementary products.
Our acquisition criteria require a strong existing management team, moderate to
low-cost products that enhance our value to customers as a single source
supplier, and the ability to enhance earnings upon consolidation. Our
acquisition of Plezall Wipers early last year is a good case in point. Now part
of our CCP Industries unit, Plezall increased CCP's scale by expanding
significantly our line of woven textiles thereby, complementing our non-woven
product offerings, expanding CCP's markets and customer base, and opening new
opportunities for market penetration. Plezall was successfully integrated into
CCP and contributed to CCP's strong sales and profit results in fiscal 1996.

     Our strategy of implementing information technology has been effective in
improving our sales forecasting, purchasing practices, inventory management, and
cost controls, and in helping to identify market and other trends which offer
opportunity. We are working smarter and more efficiently. Just one reflection of
this is that in a year of rising costs (fiscal 1996), we experienced a modest
decline in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expense to sales.

     Important to migrating this technology throughout the Tranzonic
organization is the third part of our core strategy--enabling human resource
development. Strong division management in each of our business units is
supported by the valued experience and dedication of the people who make

up our organization. We rely on them individually and as a team to absorb and
successfully integrate new technologies into their operations, and to identify
the products and services which strengthen our relationships with customers.

                                   THE OUTLOOK

     We believe the near- and long-term outlook for The Tranzonic Companies is
bright. While fiscal 1996 produced a pause in our bottom line growth, we believe
that the results of the divestitures will be positive. Proceeds of the sales,
along with our strong financial position and ready access to capital, provide
ample resources to support our acquisition pursuits and other corporate
requirements. We will continue our assessment of each division in the context of
the changing needs of our markets and how to best meet them, and this year we
will implement strategic refinements to our operations that focus on
strengthening our customer-partner relationships and growing our position in the
industrial and institutional markets.

     We would like to commend our employees who remain focused on quality and
customer service. We also are grateful to our directors for their important
contributions in shaping our Company and thank our customers for their loyalty
and our shareholders for their continued support in this challenging transition
period.

HOSPITAL SPECIALTY

                    ...the Division is focused on reducing manufacturing costs,
                    improving productivity, and maintaining an aggressive
                    marketing posture to hold or gain share...

     Hospital Specialty, the Company's Personal Care Division and largest
operating unit, had a modest increase in sales to a new record level in fiscal
1996, with increases recorded in all but one major product category. Operating
profits, however, fell well below those of the prior year primarily as a result
of rapid cost increases in raw materials such as fluff pulp, which is used in
many of the Division's products, and continued pricing pressure in all markets
served. The impact of raw material increases would have been substantially
greater but for the Division's forward purchases of fluff pulp as prices rose.
While the Division was able to obtain price increases for some of its products,
the markets it serves remain very price sensitive. In this environment, the
Division is focused on reducing manufacturing costs, improving productivity, and
maintaining an aggressive marketing posture to hold or gain share.

     The Division serves institutional, industrial and to a lesser extent
consumer markets with a broad line of personal care and washroom related
products. Several initiatives undertaken during the year helped to improve
quality and service to distributor-partners and retail customers, and
contributed to sales growth. These initiatives included: introduction of
restroom deodorant systems; continued product bundling for industrial
distribution; improved use of computerized distribution systems; restructuring
of sales, technical and administrative staff; and aggressive marketing of many
new products.

     Building on its program of bundling synergistic products, the Division's
"Total Washroom Essentials" (TWE) program accounted for solid growth including
sales of restroom deodorant systems. The TWE program features MAXITHINS(R) and
GARDS(R) feminine napkins, Tampax(R) brand tampons, HEALTHGARDS(R) toilet seat
covers, HEALTHGARDS(R) odor control systems, and Hospeco washroom accessories.

     The TWE program was introduced in fiscal 1995 and has proven successful
through offering an integrated bundle of value-added products to institutional
and industrial customers. The program is a significant shift from traditional
product focus to a total program concept that enhances the Division's value as a
single-source supplier to our industrial distributors.

     The largest sales gain came from the toilet seat cover segment where the
Division was able to gain market share. In addition to toilet seat covers, sales
of restroom deodorant systems were also strong throughout most of the year. Both
are integral lines in the Division's core business. The institutional business
offers the greatest opportunities for profitable growth which will be augmented
by new products added through internal development and acquisitions. As noted in
the Letter to Shareholders, the Division sold its douche and enema product lines
during the year, thus reducing its exposure to a particularly price-sensitive
segment of the retail marketplace.

CCP INDUSTRIES, INC.


                    ...additional development and enhancement of key procurement
                    relationships resulted in a better than expected expansion
                    into wholesale channel sales...

     Fiscal 1996 was a year of record performance for CCP Industries, our
Industrial Textiles Division. All three of the Division's business units: CCP
U.S., CCP Canada and Plezall Wipers, acquired at the beginning of the fiscal
year, contributed to the significant gains in sales and operating income.

     This superior performance was driven by a number of key initiatives in
CCP's business plan. Continuous improvement initiatives in marketing, sales
management and operations resulted in product line diversification, development
of additional management information systems, sales training and service
enhancements. Additional development and enhancement of key procurement
relationships resulted in a better than expected expansion into wholesale
channel sales. These accomplishments were consistent with business strategies
which focus on customer relationship management, strategic acquisitions and
alliances, profit maximization and development of a progressive corporate
culture.

     Lavatory supplies, safety products and work apparel product categories
registered the strongest growth last year. Growth in all product categories is
accomplished most effectively by increasing sales to existing customers. Product
development and line diversification play a large part in achieving that end.
During the past year dozens of products were added to the Division's work
apparel, wiping cloths, washroom, chemicals and cleaning supplies, and safety
lines. CCP has sharpened its focus on specific industry segments, such as
automotive and graphics, to achieve greater market penetration. It has expanded
its use of telephone sales and developed new management information enabling CCP
quickly to direct its resources toward under-performing areas. All of these
initiatives have contributed to CCP's ability to serve customers in a broad
array of industrial, commercial and institutional markets.

     Intensive on-going sales training programs equip our more than 250 sales
people to better communicate the benefits and cost savings which CCP offers as a
primary supplier. Among these benefits are quality guaranteed product bundles,
application solutions, reduced procurement cost through our Primary Supplier
Approach, and customized products and solutions. Training extends to programs
aimed at improving management skills, and addresses specific operating functions
such as purchasing, inventory management, computer systems, and safety, to name
only a few. In addition to helping employees develop their potential and become
more productive, training is an important inducement to retaining the best
people.

     CCP continues to develop into a progressive manufacturing and distribution
company focused on long-term growth, supported by a large sales force and
product line diversification that improves its position as a primary supplier to
customers. To increase this diversification, CCP will continue to develop
creative resources and undertake strategic acquisitions and alliances that
strengthen relationships with major suppliers and heighten value to customers.

BAXTER TUBE COMPANY

                    ...Baxter employees provide a high degree of knowledgeable
                    support in product application and problem solving that
                    enhances customer satisfaction...

     Baxter Tube Company, our Industrial Packaging Division, overcame a myriad
of challenges in fiscal 1996 to score double-digit increases in sales over the
prior record year and achieve the best operating earnings in its history. This
progress was achieved despite flattening of sales among some existing customers
as business levels peaked. Baxter offset this condition through a combination of
pricing initiatives which enabled it to hold its position with existing
customers while successfully developing new account activity.

     Baxter met the challenges of rapidly rising raw material costs and
restricted availability of certain raw materials through internal improvements
and corrective actions which, combined with a recent easing in the raw material
market and active purchasing efforts, indicates improved earnings potential in
the period ahead.

     Baxter produces spiral wound paper tubes, cores and sleeves for a wide
variety of industrial applications. It focuses on customer relations with an
emphasis on consumable products that meet all requirements for cost
effectiveness and quality. Baxter's products are used in industries, such as
fiberglass production, where its forming tubes have proven to be technically
superior and cost-efficient, and in the automotive industry where Baxter
products have found a wide range of general and product-specific uses. While
Baxter's business is global, the majority of revenue arises in the United
States.

     Baxter's products are manufactured under carefully controlled conditions
emphasizing techniques that ensure the high quality required to satisfy our
customers' performance criteria. This close attention to quality manufacturing
was recognized again in fiscal 1996 as the Division's Minerva, Ohio, plant
achieved International Organization for Standardization Certification,
ISO-9002:94. Its Ware Shoals, South Carolina, plant received that status in
fiscal 1995. ISO Certification affirms, through an audit by the ISO third party
assessor, that a company documents its quality policies and procedures, trains
its people and audits processes to ensure compliance. The Certification
confirms, in effect, that Baxter does what it says it will do in delivering
products manufactured to its high quality levels. Since only some 700 U.S.
companies are currently ISO Certified, Baxter is in very select company. In
addition to a strong quality system, Baxter employees provide a high degree of
knowledgeable support in product application and problem solving that enhances
customer satisfaction.

     Baxter's sales efforts will be enhanced by further training and aggressive
deployment of its direct sales force--an initiative that will impact positively
its ability to sell in increasing depth to volume core and tube users. In
addition, the Division remains focused on continued product development and
increased plant productivity.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
                       FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995

   
    On February 29, 1996, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell for
cash substantially all net operating assets of its Housewares Division, Design
Trend. Conse-quently, results of operations discussed below have been
reclassified to reflect both continuing and discontinued operations. The
divestiture, which occurred on March 29, 1996, represents a strategic
redirection in the Company's allocation of resources away from the consumer
retail market.  The downward trend in profitability brought about by increasing
raw materials costs, coupled with the immense purchasing and pricing power of
mass merchandisers lead to management's decision to divest the Housewares
Division and refocus the Company's resources towards its strengths in industrial
and institutional markets which the Company's continuing operations serve.

    As a result of that transaction, the Company incurred a fourth quarter
non-cash after-tax charge of $7.3 million, or $2.06 per share. This charge,
representing a loss on disposal of discontinued operations, includes mainly the
write-off of goodwill which approximated 5.5 million, losses recorded on sale
of net assets which approximated 2.2 million, transaction costs which
approximated $600 thousand and contingent accruals which approximated $200
thousand.  Earnings from discontinued operations of $410 thousand, or 12 cents
per share combined with the loss on disposal, resulted in a fiscal 1996 loss
from discontinued operations of $6.8 million, or $1.94 per share. Earnings from
discontinued operations in fiscal 1995 were $754 thousand, or 22 cents per
share. In combining continued and discontinued operations the Company reported
a fiscal 1996 net loss of $2.4 million, or 69 cents per share, compared with
prior fiscal year earnings of $5.3 million, or $1.51 per share.
    

    Sales from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended February 29, 1996
were $137.2 million, 8.1 percent above the $126.9 million of fiscal 1995. Each
of the three continuing operating units contributed to this sales gain. Of the
sales increase recorded in fiscal 1996, 52 percent resulted from the addition of
Plezall Wipers, acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year. Selective price
increases instituted during the year added 30 percent to year over year sales
gains. The introduction of new products such as our restroom deodorants systems
distributed through Hospital Specialty (our Personal Care Division), and the
expansion of new safety products distributed by CCP Industries (our Industrial
Textiles Division), added 16 percent to the fiscal year overall increase. The
Company's continuing initiatives to improve sales force effectiveness through
product line extensions, sales force training and the use of sales management
information systems helped to improve volume sales.

    The cost of goods sold for continuing operations increased to 68.6 percent
of sales in fiscal 1996 from 65.8 percent for fiscal 1995. This increase was the
result of a combination of forces, including the dramatic increase in the price
of fluff pulp and paper which did not begin to subside until late in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1996. Pricing of fluff pulp, the major raw material component
of product cost at Hospital Specialty, nearly doubled at its peak in late fiscal
1996 over its lowest level in fiscal 1995. Other factors influencing cost of
goods as a percent of sales include competitive pricing in consumer markets and
the increase in sales of lower gross margin wholesale products.

   
    Tight control of selling, general and administrative expenses and continued
improvement in administrative efficiency resulting from the effective use of
technology in the areas of marketing and distribution resulted in a decrease in
these expenses to 26.1 percent of sales for fiscal 1996 from 28.2 percent for
the prior fiscal year. Two other events, which occurred during the fourth
quarter of the current fiscal year, added to this favorable decline. Consistent
with the strategic redirection exemplified by the sale of Design Trend, our
Hospital Specialty Division sold for a gain ($931,800) certain assets comprising
its douche and enema line of business. In addi-
    

                                       14

tion, the insurance company which administers the Company's health and welfare
benefits plan converted to a stock company from a mutual company. In the
conversion, the Company received shares which it sold for a gain        
($604,500). The proceeds will be used to fund future health claims.

    Earnings from continued operations declined 2.5 percent to $4.4 million in
fiscal 1996 from $4.5 million in fiscal 1995. Highly competitive and
price-sensitive customers forced the Company to absorb rapidly escalating raw
material costs in several product categories. As a result, earnings from
continued operations fell to 3.2 percent from 3.6 percent in fiscal 1995.

   
    Net interest expense increased to $594 thousand in fiscal 1996, as compared
to $317 thousand in fiscal 1995. This 87.2 percent increase was the result of
higher borrowing levels related to the acquisition of Plezall and forward
purchases of raw materials, and higher interest rates which raised the cost of
borrowing. Interest coverage, calculated as operating earnings divided by net
interest expense, fell to 12.1 times for fiscal 1996 from 24.0 times for fiscal
1995.  Reflective of this increase in interest expense, weighted average debt
outstanding in fiscal 1996 was $9,855,000 as compared to $6,625,000 in fiscal
1995.  The weighted average interest rate in fiscal 1996 was 6.96 percent as
compared to 5.85 percent in fiscal 1995.

    Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 1996
declined to $6.6 million from $7.3 million in the preceding fiscal year.
Consistent with the lower earnings, income taxes fell to $2.2 million from $2.8
million for fiscal 1995. The effective tax rate also declined to 32.9 percent
for fiscal 1996 versus 38.0 percent for the prior fiscal year. This improvement
resulted from lower state and local taxes and the increase in tax-exempt income
earned by the Company.  Earnings per share from continuing operations were
$1.25 per share in fiscal 1996 as compared to $1.29 in fiscal 1995.  The
decline resulted solely from the decline in earnings, as the weighted average
number of shares outstanding did not change materially.

    Earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes were $410 thousand
in fiscal 1996, down from $754 thousand in fiscal 1995.  Despite a 9.8 percent
increase in sales year over year, earnings declined 45.6 percent as a result of
product mix shift and significantly higher costs for both steel and cotton, the
primary components of goods sold for the discontinued operation.
    

                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
                       FISCAL 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1994

    Fiscal 1995 sales from continuing operations were $126.9 million, 9.5
percent above the $115.9 million level achieved in fiscal 1994. Growth in adult
incontinent product sales provided the largest increase in sales for Hospital
Specialty. Sales gains at CCP Industries and Baxter Tube resulted from strong
general domestic economic growth and improved marketing efficiencies.

    Cost of goods sold decreased slightly to 65.8 percent of sales in fiscal
1995 versus 66.0 percent of sales in fiscal 1994. Product mix changes and
procurement opportunities more than offset the initial stages of raw material
cost increases which carried into fiscal 1996.

    The implementation of technology to improve efficiency resulted in the
reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales
to 28.2 percent in fiscal 1995, from 29.4 percent in 1994. Improved productivity
allows the expense level to be leveraged over greater volume.

   
    Net interest expense increased 22.5 percent, primarily as a result of higher
interest rates and the year-over-year impact of borrowings to finance
acquisitions made in fiscal 1994. Interest coverage for fiscal 1995 was 24.0
times.

    Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 1995 of
$7.3 million provided a 94.3 percent increase over the $3.8 million recorded in
fiscal 1994. As a result, income taxes for fiscal 1995 rose to $2.8 million from
$1.4 million for the prior fiscal year. The tax rate was 38.0 percent for fiscal
1995 and fiscal 1994.
    


                                       15

<PAGE>   57
   
    Fiscal 1995 earnings from continuing operations totaled $4.5 million,
compared to the $2.3 million, reported in fiscal 1994.  Earnings per share from
continuing operations were $1.29 per share in fiscal 1995 compared to 67 cents
in fiscal 1994.  The improvement was solely attributable to the increase in
earnings, as the weighted average number of shares outstanding did not change
materially.  Included in continuing operations for the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1994 is a $1.3 million (or 22 cents per share) charge taken by the
Company in connection with the restructuring of its Housewares Division.  The
charge included costs of shutting down duplicate facilities in Dallas and 
Philadelphia, termination costs and moving expenses.

    Earnings from discontinued operations net of income taxes were $754
thousand in fiscal 1995 as compared to $468 thousand in fiscal 1994.  The
increase of 61 percent was the result of the combination of Ever-Ready
Appliance Mfg. Co., aquired late in the fiscal 1994 second quarter.

    Consolidated net earnings in fiscal 1995 increased to $5.3 million, or
$1.51 per share, from $2.8 million, or 80 cents per share in fiscal 1994.
    

                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    The Company's financial position continues to be strong. Current assets are
3.2 times current liabilities at February 29, 1996 as compared to 2.9 times at
February 28, 1995. Cash and cash equivalents nearly tripled by fiscal year end
1996 as a result of strong operating cash flow and the influx of cash from
Hospital Specialty's sale of its douche and enema line of business. The
reclassification of certain non-current assets to current as a result of the
Housewares Division divestiture also added to an improved current ratio.

    Working capital at fiscal year end of $33.2 million increased 9.6 percent
from the prior year's $30.3 million. The Company's debt-to-equity ratio of 14.2
percent at fiscal year end increased from 14.5 percent at prior year end.

    Cash provided from operations is the primary source of liquidity and
amounted to $9.7 million in fiscal 1996, $3.9 million in fiscal 1995 and $7.2
million in fiscal 1994. These internally generated funds are used primarily for
capital expenditures, dividends paid to shareholders and other miscellaneous
investing and financing activities.

    The Company invested $3.2 million in property, plant and equipment to expand
capacity and improve productivity. This amount compares to the $2.6 million
invested in fiscal 1995 and $2.8 million in fiscal 1994. Fiscal 1997 investments
are budgeted to be consistent with prior years.

    In March 1995, the Company acquired Plezall Wipers, Inc., a Miami, Florida
distributor of woven textile wipers, for $2.9 million in a cash transaction
accounted for as a purchase.

    In fiscal 1996 the Company increased its dividend payout to shareholders 7.7
percent to $885 thousand from $822 thousand. The Company's objective is to
increase dividends periodically in a manner consistent with increases in free
cash flow.

    The Company maintains a $30.0 million line of credit to finance working
capital requirements if needed and to finance acquisitions. Cash received
subsequent to fiscal year end 1996 from the sale of the Housewares Division was
used to pay off outstanding debt.

    In fiscal 1995 the need to increase certain inventory stock at Design Trend
to strengthen its ability to respond quickly to orders and the need to stock raw
materials ahead of price increases at Hospital Specialty, caused the downward
trend in cash provided by operations as compared to fiscal 1994. Further debt
repayment and investments in property, plant and equipment in fiscal 1995 also
added to the decreased cash levels from fiscal 1994.

                               ACCOUNTING CHANGES

   
    In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," which provides a basis for measurement and recognition of all
stock-based employee compensation plans. The disclosure requirements of this
Statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The
Company expects that it will maintain its current accounting 
    



                                       16
<PAGE>   58
method for stock-based compensation and disclose the pro-forma effects on net
income and earnings per share of the fair market value method as permitted by
the Statement.

                                    INFLATION

    Fiscal 1996 saw rising raw material costs, particularly for fluff pulp,
paper and steel which significantly outpaced general inflation. Competitive
pricing and customer pricing pressures, especially in the retail sectors which
the Company serves, put downward pressure on operating margins. The Company
attempts to alleviate these pressures by increasing selling prices to help
offset rising costs, increasing productivity and improving manufacturing
techniques.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                                         THE TRANZONIC COMPANIES

Years Ended February 29, 1996, and February 28, 1995 and 1994 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF
  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Tranzonic Companies manufactures and distributes nationally a wide
variety of products to the industrial, institutional and consumer sectors
through its three remaining operating divisions. The principal market for the
Company's products is the continental United States. Tranzonic's Personal Care
Division, Hospital Specialty, provides personal care and other washroom related
products. Its Industrial Textiles Division, CCP Industries, distributes
industrial wiping cloths, washroom supplies, specialty chemicals, and safety and
work apparel. Baxter Tube, its Industrial Packaging Division, manufactures paper
tubes, cores and sleeves used in a wide variety of industrial applications. 

(1) Principles of Consolidation
   All of the Company's subsidiaries are wholly-owned and their accounts are
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All material
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

(2) Inventories
   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

(3) Property, Plant and Equipment
   Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets.

(4) Intangibles
   Goodwill, the excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies, is being
amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. At each quarterly balance sheet
date, management assesses whether there has been an impairment in the carrying
value, primarily by reviewing current and projected sales, operating income and
annual cash flows. 

(5) Income Taxes
   Deferred taxes are provided on the asset and liability method whereby
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss
carryforwards, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary
differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of
changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

   The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return with its
subsidiaries.

(6) Share Options
   Upon the exercise of Class A or Class B Common Share options granted under
the Company's incentive share option plans, the Company, at its discretion, can
either distribute newly issued shares or shares from treasury. Additional
paid-in capital is adjusted to reflect the balance of the option price. 

(7) Net Earnings Per Common and Common Equivalent Share
   Net earnings per common and common equivalent share have been calculated
based on the weighted average Class A and Class B Common Shares outstanding
during the period plus the incremental shares (calculated using the treasury
share method) for those outstanding share options which are considered common
share equivalents. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares used in
the calculation were 3,525,457, 3,508,467, and 3,515,658 in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively. 

(8) Cash Equivalents
   The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments, with
maturities when purchased of three months or less, to be cash equivalents.

(9) Revenue Recognition
   The Company recognizes revenue as goods are shipped to customers.

(10) Deferred Gain
   The deferred gain recorded on the books of the Company which resulted from a
sale and leaseback of certain real property is being amortized in proportion to
rental payments over 20 years, the life of the lease.

<PAGE>   64

(11) New Accounting Pronouncements
   In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation," which provides a basis for measurement and recognition of all
stock-based employee compensation plans. The disclosure requirements of this
Statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The
Company expects that it will maintain its current accounting method for
stock-based compensation and disclose the pro-forma effects on net income and
earnings per share of the fair market value method as permitted by the
Statement. 

(12) Use of Estimates
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

(13) Reclassification
   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.


B    ACQUISITIONS / RESTRUCTURING
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   On March 1, 1995, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Plezall Wipers, Inc., a Miami, Florida,
distributor of woven textile wipers for $2.9 million in a cash transaction. The
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Results
of operations have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition.

   
   In fiscal 1994, the Company announced plans to consolidate the operating
units making up its Housewares Division. As a result, the Company recorded a
$1,300,000 charge to operating earnings ($792,000 after tax or 22 cents per
share).  The charge includes costs of shutting down duplicate facilities in
Dallas and Philadelphia, termination costs and moving expenses.  The project
was sucessfully completed in the first quarter of fiscal 1995 with no material
difference in amounts incurred and paid to those estimated in fiscal 1994.
    

   Results of operations of Ever-Ready Appliance Mfg. Co., acquired on August
13, 1993, classified as discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture
of the Housewares Division, have been reflected in the Company's consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition.

Revolving credit .............    $  7,000,000    7,600,000
- ----------------------------------============    =========
</TABLE>

   
   The Company has a $30,000,000 revolving credit facility maturing June 30,
1997. Funds borrowed may be used for working capital and/or acquisition
purposes. In lieu of a compensating balance requirement, the agreement requires
an annual fee of 3/10 of 1% on the unused portion. At the Company's option,
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at either the bank's prime rate or
at 1/2 of 1% above an adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to certain conditions in the 
rate structure. 
    

   
                                       23

   At February 29, 1996, interest rates applicable to total borrowings
outstanding range from 5.8125% to 5.875%.
    

   The debt agreements contain restrictions on the Company with respect to
investments, maintenance of working capital, net worth, use of cash for payments
of dividends, and purchase of treasury shares. Capital distributions during any
fiscal year are limited to 50% of average consolidated net earnings over a
three-year period. The Company was in compliance with all debt agreement
restrictions or has obtained waivers.


G    SHARE OPTIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Company has three performance share option plans in effect for key
employees. Under these plans 180,000 Class A Common Shares and 400,000 Class B
Common Shares were reserved for issuance at a per share option price of not less
than 100% of the market price on the dates these options were awarded.
Additionally, 60,000 Class A Common Shares were reserved for issuance at a per
share option price from 10% to 95% of the market price on the dates these
options were awarded, and 95,000 Class B Common Shares were granted as part of
certain employment contracts at 100% of market price at the date of grant. At

   The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of February 29, 1996 is
$1,506,995. This newly established allowance represents the Federal tax effect
of a net capital loss carryforward created through the divestiture of the
Housewares Division. The capital loss carryforward is available to offset future
net capital gains, if any, through fiscal year 2002.


J    SEGMENT DATA
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The industry segment in which the Company operates is primarily the
conversion of paper and allied products. 

   The majority of the Company's products originate from large rolls of paper
or allied products purchased directly from mills where such materials are
manufactured. As such, each of the Company's divisions displays similar
purchasing function characteristics. Also, the end-use of most of the Company's
products is similar, as the majority of sales are of disposable products used
for personal hygiene and cleaning.

   The Company's foreign operations and export sales are immaterial.


K    LEASE COMMITMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Company conducts operations at certain facilities under various
non-cancellable operating leases. Rent expense charged to continuing operations
was $1,515,572, $1,328,365 and $1,180,269 in fiscal years 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

   Rental commitments at February 29, 1996 for noncancellable operating leases
with initial terms greater than one year are as follows:

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
The Tranzonic Companies:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Tranzonic
Companies and subsidiaries as of February 29, 1996 and February 28, 1995, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 29, 1996.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Tranzonic
Companies and subsidiaries as of February 29, 1996 and February 28, 1995, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended February 29, 1996, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

              Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

                 Three-month periods ended May 31, 1996 and 1995



Note A     In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed
           consolidated financial statements contain such adjustments (all of
           which are normal and recurring in nature) necessary to present fairly
           the financial position of The Tranzonic Companies and subsidiaries
           (Company) at May 31, 1996 and the results of operations for the
           three-month periods ended May 31, 1996 and 1995. The statements
           should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
           statements and notes thereto included in the Company's annual report
           for the fiscal year ended February 29, 1996.

Note B     Net earnings per share have been calculated based on the weighted
           average Class A common and Class B common shares outstanding during
           the periods plus the incremental shares (calculated using the
           treasury share method) for those outstanding share options which are
           considered equivalent shares and have a dilutive impact on net
           earnings per share.

           The table below depicts the average Class A common and Class B common
           shares used in the calculation of net earnings per share for the
           reported periods:

                 -----------------------------------------------
                  Financial Condition and Results of Operation
                  --------------------------------------------



The Company's financial position remains strong. At May 31, 1996, the current
ratio was 2.9:1 and current assets continued to exceed total liabilities.

Revenues from continuing operations in the first fiscal quarter ended May 31,
1996 increased slightly to $34.7 million from $34.4 million as recorded in the
prior year like period. Volume revenue gains from the extension of existing
product lines, mostly serving the Company's institutional customers, were
largely offset by a decrease in revenues from the fiscal 1996 fourth quarter
sale of our Personal Care Division's douche and enema line of business and
reduced revenues from certain other product lines.

Gross margins in the current year first quarter were 32.6 percent, down
factionally from 32.8 percent of a year ago. Raw material costs, particularly
fluff pulp, which have influenced cost of sales during the current year fiscal
quarter are in a downward trend, and approaching the level of the prior year
like period. In addition, product mix shifts to historically higher margin
products were offset to some degree with competitive pricing pressures.

Operating margins in the current year first quarter improved to 6.7 percent of
sales as compared to 5.0 percent of sales from the prior year. Cost containment
and efficiency programs covering administration, distribution, and marketing
have reflected positively on earnings.

On March 28, 1996, the Company closed on the divestiture of its Housewares
Division substantially as expected when the Company reported the sale in the
prior year fourth fiscal quarter. The cash proceeds received were used to pay
off the outstanding line of credit, with the remainder invested in short-term
cash investments. As a consequence, interest income has increased and interest
expense has decreased on a quarter to quarter comparison.

Earnings from continuing operations in the first quarter ended May 31, 1996
increased to $1.5 million or 44 cents per share up 45.9 percent from $1.0
million or 30 cents per share recorded in the like period a year ago.

Cash increased $3.2 million during the first quarter along with a $2.0 million
increase in short-term investments. Cash generated from operations of $3.1
million, cash received from the Housewares Division divestiture of $10.0
million, and the pay off of $7.0 million in long-term debt were key
contributors to this net increase.

                       INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REVIEW REPORT
                       -----------------------------------



The Board of Directors
The Tranzonic Companies:

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of The Tranzonic
Companies and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1996, and the related condensed
consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the three-month periods
ended May 31, 1996 and 1995. These condensed consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical review procedures to
financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is
the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a
whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should
be made to the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above for
them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated balance sheet of The Tranzonic Companies and
subsidiaries as of February 29, 1996, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not
presented herein); and in our report dated March 29, 1996, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion,
the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of February 29, 1996, is fairly presented, in all material respects, in
relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
