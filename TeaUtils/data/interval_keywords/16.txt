or about August 28, 2000, in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
Board of Directors of the Company to be used at the 2000 Annual Meeting ("Annual
Meeting").

If you are a stockholder of record (i.e., you hold your shares in your own name
other than through a broker, bank or other nominee), you are encouraged to
submit your proxy vote electronically either by telephone or via the internet.
This will eliminate the need to sign, date and return your proxy card. To submit
your proxy by telephone or over the internet you will be required to enter the
control number assigned to you and imprinted on your proxy card accompanying
this Proxy Statement. The vote by telephone and vote by internet systems can be
accessed 24 hours a day, seven days a week until the day prior to the meeting.

    - TO SUBMIT YOUR PROXY VOTE BY TELEPHONE:

       - USING A TOUCH-TONE PHONE, CALL 1-877-PRX-VOTE (1-877-779-8683)
         TOLL-FREE AND FOLLOW THE VOICE PROMPTS

       - FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, CALL 1-201-536-8073 DIRECT AND FOLLOW
         THE VOICE PROMPTS

    - TO SUBMIT YOUR PROXY VOTE BY INTERNET:

       - LOG ONTO INTERNET WEBSITE AT HTTP://WWW.EPROXYVOTE.COM/AAR AND ENTER
         YOUR VOTER CONTROL NUMBER ON YOUR PROXY CARD AND MARK THE APPROPRIATE
         BOXES TO ENTER VOTING INSTRUCTIONS

If you are a street-name stockholder (i.e., you hold your shares through a
broker, bank or other nominee), you will receive instructions from your broker,
bank or other nominee describing how you may vote your shares.

You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is exercised, but only by
voting in person at the Annual Meeting, or by submitting another proxy by
telephone, over the internet, or delivering a later dated, signed proxy to the
Secretary of the Company.

Proxies will be voted in accordance with instructions on the proxy. If no
instructions are specified, the named proxy holders will vote FOR the election
of the two nominees for director designated by the Board, and upon any other
matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting in their discretion and
best judgment. The Board may nominate another person if any nominee becomes
unavailable for election for any reason prior to the Annual Meeting vote. In
that event, the named proxy holders will vote for that other person.

                                       1
<PAGE>
The cost of the solicitation of proxies will be paid by the Company. The Company
has engaged D. F. King & Co., 77 Water Street, New York, New York, to aid in the
solicitation of proxies at a total estimated cost of $8,000, plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. D. F. King & Co. may solicit proxies by mail, by
telephone, by facsimile, by e-mail, or in person. Certain officers, directors
and employees of the Company may also solicit proxies.

                  RECORD DATE AND VOTING AT THE ANNUAL MEETING

Stockholders owning Common Stock of the Company ("Common Stock") outstanding at
the close of business on the record date, August 16, 2000, may vote at the 2000
Annual Meeting. On that date, 26,856,636 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding. Stockholders will have one vote on each matter to be voted on for
each share held on the record date. Shares cannot be voted unless the owner is
present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. The holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person
or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum. Votes cast in person or by
proxy will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed for the Annual
Meeting. The inspectors of election will treat directions to withhold authority,
abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are present and entitled to vote
for purposes of determining a quorum. Directions to withhold authority will have
no effect on the election of directors, because directors are elected by a
plurality of votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded
for purposes of determining whether a matter has been approved, because they are
not considered votes cast.

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company provide
that the Board shall consist of between three and fifteen directors. The exact
number of directors is set from time to time by the Board and is presently set
at eight. The eight members of the Board are divided into three classes:
Class I (2 directors), Class II (3 directors) and Class III (3 directors). One
class is elected each year for a three-year term.

During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2000 ("Fiscal 2000"), the Board held six
meetings. All of the incumbent directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate
meetings of the Board and of the Committees on which they served except for
Mr. Jannotta whose attendance was 73% in the aggregate.

In addition, each Eligible Director receives term life insurance coverage of
$200,000 and a one-time grant upon becoming a director of stock options for
10,000 shares of Company Common Stock under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan.
These options can be exercised in 25% increments on each anniversary grant date
at the closing New York Stock Exchange price on the date of grant.

Each Eligible Director also will receive benefits under the AAR CORP. Directors'

are paid quarterly in cash in an amount equal to 25% of the annual retainer
payable to an active eligible director and are paid for a period equal to the
total number of years of service as a director to a maximum of ten years or

                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

The Board of Directors is currently divided into three classes, each having
three-year terms that expire in successive years. At this year's Annual Meeting,
the Board of Directors has nominated two directors to be elected in Class I,
each to serve a three-year term expiring at the Annual Meeting in the year 2003
or until the individual is succeeded by another qualified director who has been
duly elected.

The nominees for Director in Class I this year are JOEL D. SPUNGIN AND DAVID P.
STORCH.

The Board expects all nominees to serve if elected as directors. If any of them
should become unavailable to serve as a director for any reason prior to the
Annual Meeting, the Board may substitute another person as nominee. Under
Delaware law and the Company's By-Laws, the two nominees for director who
individually receive the greatest number of votes shall be elected directors of
the Company.

                     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT
                      STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR BOTH NOMINEES

                         OTHER MATTERS TO BE VOTED UPON

Management knows of no other matters which are to be brought before this Annual
Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting,
the named proxy holders will vote all proxies in their discretion and best
judgment on such other matters.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Based solely upon a review of Securities and Exchange Commission Forms 3, 4 and
5 and upon related written representations furnished to the Company with respect
to its most recent fiscal year, no person who, at any time during the fiscal
year, was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of
any class of equity securities of the Company registered pursuant to Section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), failed to file on a
timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the
most recent fiscal year, except that one Form 3 Initial Statement was
inadvertently filed late by Michael J. Sharp (appointed Vice President/ Chief
Accounting Officer on 4/13/99) in October, 1999.

                  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

GENERAL

The Company's executive compensation program is structured and administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Committee is comprised
of the four individuals listed below, all of whom are independent directors of
the Company.

The executive compensation program is designed to enable the Company to attract,
motivate and retain talented executives capable of achieving strategic business
initiatives and to reward them for their achievement. It is designed to
complement the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives and to
focus executives' efforts on fulfilling these objectives. The program consists
of

                                       8
<PAGE>
three elements: (i) base salaries which are generally set at approximately the
median salary level of comparable positions in similar companies, adjusted up or
down to reflect individual capabilities and responsibilities and experience
levels and other relevant factors; (ii) annual variable incentive opportunities
paid in cash and stock based on individual contribution and performance; and
(iii) long-term incentive opportunities, in the form of stock option/restricted
stock awards.

Total compensation opportunities for each executive are intended to be
competitive with those offered by other companies competing for talent in the
Company's employment market. In designing and administering the individual
elements of the executive compensation program for each executive, the Committee
strives to balance short- and long-term incentive objectives and employ prudent
judgment in establishing base salary levels and performance criteria, evaluating
performance and determining actual incentive payments. To ensure competitiveness
and reasonableness of the Committee's compensation decisions, independent
compensation consulting firms are retained periodically to advise the Committee
in connection with both the design and implementation of the various elements of
the program and the level of individual executive participation. The Company
uses competitive compensation analyses by independent consultants to ensure that
the President and Chief Executive Officer's and other executive officers' base
salaries and total compensation are at an appropriate competitive level relative
to compensation for such positions at other companies in the relevant employment
market. Generally, as an executive's level of responsibility increases, a
greater percentage of total compensation is based on performance, and the mix of
total compensation shifts toward stock, thereby aligning the long-term interest
of senior executives with those of stockholders. To encourage stock ownership in
the Company by senior executives, the Company has established guidelines for
ownership of Common Stock by senior management equal in value to 75% of salary,
to be voluntarily achieved. An executive's progress towards achieving these
guidelines will be one factor considered by the Committee in awarding stock
compensation to the executive in the future.

BASE SALARIES

Base salary levels of all elected corporate officers, including the President
and Chief Executive Officer, are reviewed annually by the Committee and may be
adjusted depending upon the executive's qualifications, responsibilities,
assessed performance contribution, tenure in the Company and in the position
held, and competitive salary considerations relative to similar positions at
selected companies in the employment market from which the Company draws its
executives. Adjustments in Fiscal 2000 to the base salaries of the President and
Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers named in the Summary
Compensation Table reflect the factors referred to above.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES

The President and Chief Executive Officer has an annual performance-based
incentive bonus opportunity of up to 150% of his base salary. Twenty percent of
his incentive bonus is payable in three-year restricted stock. The percentage
incentive bonus opportunity for other executive positions varies depending on
their responsibility level and 10% of any bonus paid is payable in restricted
stock.

Each fiscal year the Compensation Committee establishes specific annual cash
bonus performance goals, within guidelines approved by stockholders in 1997 and
intended to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code, for certain executive officers of the Company. These goals focus on two
categories: income and balance sheet management. The importance and weighting of
these two categories is established each year by the Compensation Committee.
Under the category of balance sheet management, the goals include one or several
of the following criteria: shareholder equity, long-term debt to capital ratio,
investment rating, debt coverage, cash flow and return on invested capital.
Under the category of income, the goals include one or several of the following:
pre-tax income, earnings per share and net income. A participant may be eligible

                                       9
<PAGE>
to earn up to 100% of such participant's salary for meeting target goals and up
to an additional 50% of salary for exceeding target goals. The amount actually
earned depends on each participant's position, bonus opportunity and actual
performance versus the pre-established goals.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES

The long-term incentive program consists of stock option and/or restricted stock
awards granted under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan approved by stockholders
in 1992. In addition, certain officers and key employees are also eligible to
receive stock options in shares of Aerospan.com, a joint venture company,
currently 50% owned by the Company.

Stock option awards typically expire 10 years from the date of grant or earlier
upon termination of employment, become exercisable in five equal increments on
successive grant anniversary dates at the NYSE closing stock price on the date
of grant, and are accompanied by reload features and, for certain individuals,
stock rights exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company.
Stock options in Aerospan.com will vest (i) in 25% increments upon 10%
incremental increases in returns on AAR CORP. common stock, or (ii) seven years
from date of grant, or (iii) immediately upon a change in control of
Aerospan.com or AAR CORP. Restrictions imposed on restricted stock awards vary
and are designed, among other things, to encourage executives to stay with the
Company and to maintain a focus on long-term objectives of the Company.
Typically, restricted stock grants vest over five (5) years (20% each
anniversary), over seven (7) years (25% on fourth anniversary, 25% on sixth
anniversary and 50% on seventh anniversary), or over 10 years (30% on fourth
anniversary, 30% on 7th anniversary and 40% on 10th anniversary); restrictions
on restricted stock used in lieu of cash to pay earned bonuses are released over
three (3) years ( 1/3 on each anniversary). Typically, awards are subject to
forfeiture if the employee terminates employment for any reason other than
retirement or disability or the Company terminates employment for cause, during
the award cycle. During the award cycle the participant receives dividends on
the restricted shares and also has the right to vote the awarded shares.

In determining stock option and restricted stock awards, the Committee considers
the recipient's position and responsibilities in the Company, performance and
contributions made during the preceding year, capabilities and potential for
future contribution to the Company, the number of options and awards previously
granted to the recipient and, for senior management, their progress toward
achieving the Company's guidelines for stock ownership by senior management.

The Board believes that Mr. Storch, as the President and Chief Executive
Officer, should have the opportunity, based on performance, to become a
significant shareholder and that the performance measures that govern his
opportunities should be both economic and shareholder value related. Such
measures should also be related to the Company's industry and investor
communities and reflect business objectives of the Company over the coming
years. Mr. Storch's Employment Agreement originally provided him the opportunity
to earn restricted stock performance shares under a long-term restricted stock
incentive program based upon the Company's performance compared to the
performance of (i) the Company's peer group index and (ii) the S&P500 index, for
both return on total capital and total return to shareholders. Mr. Storch agreed
to amend his Employment Agreement effective May 31, 2000 to delete the
opportunity to earn restricted stock performance shares. The Committee is
working with an executive compensation consultant to develop an appropriate
long-term incentive program for Mr. Storch commencing June 1, 2000. When
finalized, the Company intends to submit such performance share program for
shareholder approval to qualify the program as "performance compensation" within
the meaning of 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
("Internal Revenue Code").

Mr. Storch and other named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table
below received the long-term incentive stock options and restricted stock awards
reflected in the tables below. The number of shares covered by each grant
reflects individual contributions and performance, as well as competitive
industry practices, in the view of the Committee. The grant levels also continue
the

                                       10
<PAGE>
Board's emphasis on executive share ownership and further the Company's
objectives of tying incentive compensation to performance and aligning
executive's interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

In Fiscal 2000, Mr. Storch's annual base salary was increased to $650,000. The
high level of performance achieved by Mr. Storch throughout the year met the
goals approved by the Board of Directors for an annual incentive bonus award
equal to 50% of base salary. However, because the Company's share price
performance was disappointing at year end, Mr. Storch requested that his annual
incentive bonus for Fiscal 2000 be reduced to 15 percent (15%) of base salary.
The Compensation Committee honored that request. Twenty percent of Mr. Storch's
annual incentive bonus was paid in restricted stock.

The tables which follow this report and accompanying footnotes and narrative
reflect the decision covered by the above discussion.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally prevents any public
company from claiming a deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million for
any executive. This deduction limitation, however, does not apply to
performance-based compensation that satisfies certain requirements under
Section 162(m). The Committee has determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its shareholders to structure compensation of executive officers
so that compensation will not be subject to the deduction limit to the extent
that it can reasonably do so in a manner that provides adequate incentives and
allows the Company to attract and retain qualified executives. However, the
Committee has previously and may in the future structure compensation
arrangements that under certain circumstances may be subject to the deduction
limit. None of the compensation paid by the Company in Fiscal 2000 was subject
to the deduction limit.

STOCK OPTIONS

Options generally become exercisable 20% each year over a five-year period.
Unexercised options expire ten years after the date of grant. The stock option
exercise price is equal to the fair market value (NYSE closing price) of a share
of stock on the date of grant. The options have no value unless the stock price
appreciates and the holder satisfies the applicable vesting requirements.

The following table shows certain information with respect to stock options
granted in Fiscal 2000 to the named executive officers. It also shows how much
the named executive officers potentially may realize under two hypothetical
situations: if the stock gains 5% or 10% in value per year compounded over the
ten-year life of the options. These are assumed hypothetical rates of
appreciation required to be shown by Securities Exchange Commission regulations
as an example

                                       13

and are not a forecast of future stock price appreciation. Also included in this
table by way of example is the hypothetical increase in value to all
stockholders and to all employee optionees under such circumstances.

      surrendered and expires concurrent with the original option. The reload
      option exercise price is equal to the fair market value of the underlying
      stock on the date the original option is exercised. Reload options are

PENSION BENEFITS

QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS

The Company provides benefits to all domestic employees including the named
executive officers under a qualified retirement program that includes defined
benefits (cash balance type plan) and 401(k)/profit sharing. The defined
benefits are determined pursuant to a formula which takes into consideration the
participant's age, years of credited service, and a percentage of the
participant's compensation for the year. Compensation includes cash compensation
shown as income on an employee's Form W-2, reduced by certain items specified in
the Plan, plus amounts contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan. Compensation for
purposes of the Plan cannot exceed an annual compensation limitation of $170,000
as adjusted from time to time by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in
accordance with applicable provisions of the Code.

The aggregate salary and bonus compensation shown for the named executive
officers in the Summary Compensation Table above is the compensation currently
included for purposes of determining benefits under qualified plans as well as
the Supplemental Key Employee Retirement Benefit Plan ("SKERP") described below.
Benefits under the Plan may be limited by applicable laws or regulations. Profit
sharing and 401(k) benefits are based on voluntary contributions by employees
with a Company match of up to 2 percentage points of the first 5 percentage
points voluntarily contributed under the Plan, and a profit sharing contribution
by the Company based on the individual employee's voluntary contributions and
the economic performance of the individual employee's operating unit. The
Company's profit sharing contribution can be up to 3% of cash compensation.

NON-QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS

The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain executives and
key employees under the SKERP. Four of the named executive officers are
participants in the SKERP. The SKERP is designed to restore the approximate
amount of employer-provided benefits under the Company's qualified retirement
plan lost as a result of Code limitations, including those limiting compensation
for purposes of benefit calculations. The SKERP also provides for aggregate
retirement benefits (including qualified plan benefits) at 60% and 50% of final
average compensation (as defined in Plan documents), respectively, for the
President and CEO and for certain other executive officers designated by the
Board, including four of the named executive officers, reduced by certain items
specified in Plan documents. SKERP benefits are unfunded and are forfeited if
the participant violates a covenant not to compete set forth in the Plan
document or if employment is terminated for cause or under certain circumstances
in the event of a Change in Control as defined in the Plan document.

TABLE OF PENSION BENEFITS

The following table shows the estimated aggregate annual benefits payable upon

EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

DAVID P. STORCH

The Company has an employment agreement with Mr. Storch designed to assure his
continued services with the Company at a base compensation of $650,000 per year
or such increased amount as the Board may determine. Mr. Storch's term of
employment is continuously extended so as to have a remaining term of three
years, but shall expire upon death, disability, retirement or other termination
of employment.

Mr. Storch's agreement also includes: confidentiality and non-compete
provisions; participation in the Company's benefit plans; a severance payment
upon termination of employment by the Company for other than cause prior to a
change in control of the Company equal to two times base salary then in effect;
a severance payment equal to three (3) times his average cash compensation (base
salary plus cash bonus) for the last two fiscal years of employment upon
termination of employment under certain circumstances in the event of a change
in control of the Company; an incentive bonus opportunity of up to 150% of base
salary subject to annual financial targets approved by the Compensation
Committee (20% of any bonus is payable in three year restricted stock); certain
long-term incentive stock compensation commitments which have been previously
satisfied in prior years pursuant to terms of the agreement, a supplemental cash
payment to the extent necessary to preserve the level of benefits provided for
in the employment agreement in the event of imposition of excise taxes in
respect of "excess parachute payments" under the Code and, in the event of a
change in control of the Company, accelerated vesting of awards outstanding
under the Company's Stock Benefit Plan.

OTHER AGREEMENTS

The Company has also entered into split dollar life insurance agreements with
certain key employees, including four of the named executive officers. Under the
agreements, the Company will fund the annual insurance premiums for the policies
subject to reimbursement from the cash value or death benefit proceeds of the
policies.

The Company has entered into severance agreements with certain key employees,
including three of the named executive officers other than Mr. Storch. The
severance agreements are substantially identical, include confidentiality and
non-compete covenants, and provide for payment of compensation and certain
benefits in the event of termination of employment for other than cause,
including a change in control of the Company. Severance equal to base salary
plus any earned incentive cash bonus will be paid upon termination of employment
by the Company for other than cause (as defined in the severance agreements)
prior to a change in control of the Company. Under certain circumstances, upon
termination of employment following a change in control (as defined in the
severance agreements), the employee will receive severance equal to three times
total compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus) for the most recently
ended fiscal year or the preceding fiscal year, whichever is greater,
accelerated vesting of awards outstanding under the Company's Stock Benefit
Plan, special supplemental retirement benefits determined as if the employee had
three additional years of service under the Company's retirement plans,
continuation of certain other benefits for a period of three years, and a
supplemental cash payment to the extent necessary to preserve the level of
benefits provided for in the severance agreement in the event of imposition on
such employee of excise taxes payable in respect of "excess parachute payments"
under the Code.

                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Company's Board of Directors, upon recommendation of its Audit Committee,
has selected KPMG LLP as its independent public accountants for the fiscal year
ending May 31, 2001. Representatives of that firm are expected to be present at
the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire
and to be available to respond to appropriate questions.

             STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE YEAR 2001 ANNUAL MEETING

Any stockholder who wishes to present a proposal for consideration at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2001 must submit such proposal in
accordance with the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Under the Company's by-laws, in order for a proposal to be eligible for action
by the shareholders at and inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement and form
of proxy relating to the 2001 Annual Meeting, the stockholder must submit such

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS
                            AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER

PURPOSE

The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist the Board in fulfilling
its oversight responsibilities relating to (i) corporate accounting, disclosure
and reporting practices and legal compliance of the Company, (ii) the quality
and integrity of the Company's financial reports and (iii) the independence and
performance of the Company's internal and independent auditors.

ORGANIZATION

The Audit Committee shall be comprised of not less than three directors of the
Company who shall meet the independence and experience requirements of the New
York Stock Exchange. The members of the Audit Committee shall be appointed by
the Board on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee.

POLICY AND PROCEDURE

The Audit Committee will maintain flexible policies and procedures and meeting
schedules to enable the Audit Committee to best react to changing circumstances
and provide that the Company's accounting, disclosure and reporting practices
are in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The
Chairman of the Audit Committee may call meetings during the year as necessary.

The Committee will provide for free and open communication between the Committee
and the Company's directors, independent auditors, internal auditors and
management.

Both the Company's internal auditors and independent auditor are ultimately
accountable to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee as representatives
of the Company's shareholders.

The Audit Committee has authority to retain special legal, accounting or other
consultants to advise the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may request any
officer or employee of the Company or the Company's legal counsel or independent
auditor to attend committee meetings or to meet with any members of, or
consultants to, the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee shall make regular reports to the Board.

RESPONSIBILITIES

1.  Review and assess the adequacy of the Audit Committee charter annually and
    submit it to the Board for approval with any recommended changes.

2.  Recommend to the Board the appointment of the independent auditors to audit
    the financial statements of the Company and its divisions and subsidiaries.

3.  Review written statements from the independent auditors delineating all
    non-audit relationships between the independent auditors and the Company,
    review with the independent auditors the effect of any disclosed
    relationships or services on objectivity and independence of the independent
    auditors, and recommend to the Board appropriate action to ensure the
    independent auditors' independence.

4.  Discuss with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed
    by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 relating to the conduct of the
    audit. The Committee Chairman may represent the full committee for purposes
    of this review.

                                      E-1
<PAGE>
5.  Meet with the independent auditors and financial management of the Company
    to review the scope of the proposed audit for the upcoming year and the
    audit procedures to be used, and at the conclusion of the year review such
    audit, including any comments or recommendations of the independent
    auditors.

6.  Review with the Company's independent auditors, internal auditors, and
    financial and accounting personnel, the adequacy and effectiveness of the
    internal controls of the Company, and elicit any recommendations for the
    improvement of such internal control procedures or particular areas where
    new or more detailed controls or procedures are desirable.

7.  Review the internal audit function of the Company, including its
    organizational structure, independence of reporting obligations,
    qualification of personnel and the proposed audit plans for the coming year,
    and the coordination of such plans with the outside auditors.

8.  Receive a summary of significant findings from completed internal audits,
    together with management's response, and periodic progress reports, with
    explanation for any deviations from the original plan.

9.  Review the audited financial statements prior to their filing or
    distribution to shareholders with management and the independent auditors
    regarding (i) accounting principles, practices and judgments, (ii) whether
    the independent auditors are satisfied with the disclosure and content of
    the financial statements to be presented to the shareholders, and (iii) any
    changes in accounting principles.

10. Provide sufficient opportunity for the internal auditor and independent
    auditors to meet with the members of the Committee without members of
    management present, such meetings to occur at least twice a year. Among the
    items to be considered for discussion in these meetings are the auditors'
    evaluation of the Company's financial, accounting, and auditing personnel,
    the auditors' judgments about the Company's accounting principles as applied
    to its financial reporting; and the level of management cooperation that the
    outside auditors received during the course of the audit.

11. Review the human resources and succession planning of the accounting and
    financial operations within the Company.

12. Report on significant matters discussed at each Committee meeting to the
    Board.

13. Investigate any matter brought to its attention within the scope of its
    duties, with the power to retain outside counsel or a second independent
    accountant, at the expense of the Company, for this purpose if, in its
    judgment, that is appropriate.

14. Prepare a report to shareholders to be included in the Company's annual
    proxy statement as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

15. Perform any other activities consistent with this Charter, the Company's
    by-laws, and governing law, as the Committee or Board deems necessary or
    appropriate.

While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this
Charter, it is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or
to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate
and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is the
responsibility of management and the independent auditor. Nor is it the duty of
the Audit Committee to conduct investigations, to resolve disagreements, if any,
between management and the independent auditor or to assure compliance with laws
and regulations and the Company's Code of Conduct.
