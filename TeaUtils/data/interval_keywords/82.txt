      stock closing price on June 30, 2000 of $11.50.

On June 9, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors adopted resolutions amending
the Company's 1980 Stock Option Plan ("the Option Plan"), in the following
respects: the Plan is to be administered by a committee consisting of not less
than three directors, all of whom shall be "disinterested persons"; a committee
member shall be a "disinterested person" only if such person is not, at the
time he exercises discretion in administering the Option Plan, eligible, and
has not at any time within one year prior thereto been eligible, for selection
as a person as to whom options may be granted; and no option may be granted to
any director as to whom the proxy statement for the meeting of stockholders at
which the Option Plan was submitted for approval of the stockholders of the
Company disclosed that such director will not participate in the Option Plan.

A committee consisting of Samuel I. Hendler (Chairman), Stanley H. Fischer and
Robert A. Wiesen was appointed by the Board of Directors to administer the
Option Plan. All of said directors were disinterested persons as defined by the
Option Plan.

The Company's 1998 Omnibus Equity Award Plan is administered by the Executive
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, whose members are Leonard S.
Schwartz (Chairman), Stanley H. Fischer, Samuel I. Hendler and Robert A.
Wiesen, functions as the Executive Compensation Committee, and makes
recommendations to the Board with respect to the remuneration of the Company's
executive officers.

The Company's compensation policy has been designed to enable the Company to
attract, retain and motivate executives whose enthusiasm and abilities will
contribute to the growth of its business and result in maximum profitability to
the Company and its stockholders, by providing salaries and benefits
competitive with those offered by other companies in the chemical industry.
The executive compensation program includes base salary, annual incentive
compensation (cash bonuses), and long term incentive compensation (awards under
the Company's Omnibus Equity Award Plan).

Base salaries are set at levels competitive with the chemical industry.
Because of the way that the Company operates its business, the contributions of
its executives significantly affect corporate profitability.  Bonuses (which
can exceed base salary) are paid to reflect the extent of such contributions.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) also is the President and Chief Operating
Officer (COO) of the Company.  The bonuses paid to the CEO and to the
Secretary/Treasurer, who is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), reflect the
Company's overall performance (excluding extraordinary events).

The three highest paid executives, other than the CEO and CFO, are each
responsible for the performance of one of the Company's principal profit
centers.  Internally generated performance records are kept on a monthly and
yearly basis for these profit centers, and each center's profitability is
compared in the current year to the previous year.  Other factors considered in
determining the bonuses of individual executives are the individual's own
performance and the overall performance of the Company.  The Executive
Compensation Committee determines each bonus primarily based on this data, also
taking into account the long term contributions of each individual.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION

The CEO's compensation was determined on the basis of the same factors utilized
to compensate other executives, taking into account total compensation
comparisons of top executives of corporations considered to be in the Company's
peer group.

      The Executive Compensation Committee
            Leonard S. Schwartz, Chairman
            Stanley H. Fischer
            Samuel I. Hendler
            Robert A. Wiesen



DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Each non-employee director currently receives $12,500 per year for serving on
the Board of Directors plus $500 for each committee meeting attended. There is
no additional compensation for directors who are also employees.

Each of the then non-employee directors, Messrs. Hendler, Wiesen and Goldstein,
received stock options on December 2, 1999 under the 1998 Aceto Corporation
Omnibus Equity Award Plan.  Each stock option was for 1,000 shares at a strike
price of $11.75 and expires ten years from the date of grant.  At June 30,
2000, the closing price of Aceto Corporation common stock was $11.50.  The
options were not in-the-money.


EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

There are no employment contracts with any director, nominee for election as
director, or officer; however, Messrs. Amitrano and Schwartz have signed patent
and trade secret agreements.

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's
directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of the
registered class of the Company's equity securities to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), initial reports of ownership and reports
of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the
Company. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by
SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file. To the Company's knowledge, based solely on review of the copies of
such reports furnished to the Company and representations that no other reports
were required during the fiscal year, all Section 16(a) filing requirements
applicable to its officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners
were complied with.

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board has again appointed the firm of KPMG LLP as independent auditors for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001.  A representative of KPMG LLP will be
present at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to respond to appropriate
questions from stockholders and will have the opportunity to make a statement,
if he so desires.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Any proposal which a stockholder intends to present at the 2001 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders must be duly received by the Company on or before June 2, 2001.

II.  COMPOSITION

The Committee shall be comprised of three or more directors as determined by
the Board, at least three of such directors shall be independent directors, and
free from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere
with the exercise of  such director's independent judgment as a member of the
Committee.  "Independent director" means a person other than an officer or
employee of the Corporation or its subsidiaries or any other individual having
a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the
exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a
director.  The following persons shall not be considered independent: (a) a
director who is employed by the Corporation or any of its affiliates for the
current year or any of the past three years; (b) a director who accepts any
compensation from the Corporation or any of its affiliates in excess of
$60,000.00 during the previous fiscal year, other than compensation for Board
service; (c) a director who is a member of the immediate family of an
individual who is, or has been in any of the past three years, employed by the
Corporation or any of its affiliates as an executive officer.  Immediate family
includes a person's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mother-in-law, father-
in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and anyone who resides in such person's
home; (d) a director who is a partner in, or a controlling shareholder or an
executive officer of, any for-profit business organization to which the
Corporation made, or from which the Corporation received, payments (other than
those arising solely from investments in the Corporation's securities) that
exceed 5% of the business organization's consolidated gross revenues for that
year, or $200,000, whichever is more, in any of the past three years; or (e) a
director who is employed as an executive of another entity where any of the
Corporation's executives serve on that entity's compensation committee.]
Notwithstanding the foregoing, one director who is not independent as defined
herein, and is not a current employee or an immediate family member of such
employee, may be appointed to the Committee, if the Board has determined in its
business judgment that membership on the Committee is required by the best
interests of the Corporation and its shareholders.

All members of the Committee shall be able to read and understand fundamental
financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement,
and cash flow statement or will become able to do so within a reasonable period
of time after appointment to the Committee.  Additionally, at least one member
of the Committee, shall have past employment experience in finance or
accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or any other
comparable experience or background which results in the member's financial
sophistication, including being or having been a chief executive officer, chief
financial officer or other senior officer with financial oversight
responsibilities.  Committee members may enhance their familiarity with finance
and accounting by participating in educational programs conducted by the
Corporation or an outside consultant.

The members of the Committee shall be elected by the Board and shall serve
until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified.  Unless a Chair is
elected by the full Board, the members of the Committee may designate a Chair
by majority vote of the full Committee membership.


III.  MEETINGS

The committee shall meet at least four times annually, or more frequently as
circumstances dictate.  As part of its job to foster open communication, the
Committee should meet at least annually with management, the person in charge
of internal accounting and the independent accountants in separate executive
sessions to discuss any matters that the Committee or each of these groups
believe should be discussed privately.  In addition, the Committee or at least
its Chair should meet with the independent accountants and management quarterly
to review the Corporation's financials consistent Section I. 4 above.
